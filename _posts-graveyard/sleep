I imagine our bodies as similar to a submarine beneath the ocean.
It's as if our selves have to swim underwater in order to reach the sub,
always feeling the pull of gravity that calls us to come back above the surface.
Once we do get inside though, we can rest and take control of the submarine,
allowing us to travel far and wide. Whether we go west or east, we generally
are never much farther away from the surface. We do have to return.
