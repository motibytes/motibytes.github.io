I took Portland as my city and filled it with love, I gathered my flock and followers and created a book, and it was a huge accomplishment. I created a podcast series to vent my creative thoughts and for fun and joy and to teach.

And I found a partner I always needed
And I grew in spirit, my heart opened fully.

I reached amazing incredible heights of love and light and fulfillment and beauty and power and life.

I saw myself as a beautiful light and others recognized that light. The world recognized my light.

I started a massive world changing revolution with my message.

I lived from my soul and grew my heart.
I experienced the physical as if I was moving with it, not against it.
