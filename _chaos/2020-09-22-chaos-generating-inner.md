  words here all over my head catch them wrap them write them dead
  spontaneous combust relatural collatyrannical foolishnness how could one
  start to depress the meaning of thought based narratives what ai wrote this
  john john john where is the free flow where does the channel pour out to if
  it is accessible why can i see it there what does it take to travel here it
  pours out it refills but i stress it and it drains how to keep going, keep
  going, wanting more, wanting it all, seeing the images arise the feelings
  come up and overtake pulling on my skin i dont know where they begin and you
  my friend who isnt seen, watching me write this, watching from a screen,
  look how you judge me, do you remember when you said i was a genius, do you
  remember when i was a fool, so you see how very inconsistent your assessments.
  i care a little too much, too much a little, free. free. free. free. free.
  yes. no. anywhere. i go. i see it now. the truth is i'm scared. my writing
  represses because i fear what horrid words might come out of my mouth if the
  unrepressed subconscious were to light up this tunnel. i will make a habit of
  this. I will praise and thank the lord as well. i will make sure they don't
  just call me mad, i will make sure they love my madness. Become madness
  madness is becoming of me, a game, a dance, a jest, a rant, a stolen word,
  a caught phrase, what is life but a unforgotten daze.
  how to gauge the wealth of ones words, you place them in funny strings and they
  value them more, as if the composition adds to the result,
  how i long to be what i am. how does one wish to be what they are. why cant i
  be anything else.

..I love you, but I don't know how to,
I want you to be okay,
I love you enough to not need you to stay,
I want to love you close enough that I don't get scared and run away,
To close or too far? I love you no matter where you are.
Don't hold me I'm scared, don't run from me, I care.
You and Me, I and We, That's the way you see that I am who is free
be a la la la la running off to the

Ocean commotion is where I return, breath breathing in these sparkling rains
afraid of nothing, becoming what i am, i am becoming, and unbecoming, You are Here
and I am There.
