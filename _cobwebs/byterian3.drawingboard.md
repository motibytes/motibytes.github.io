So let's talk about
A Reset.
A New World.
How we could act differently.
How could we act differently?
In a practical way?
How can we change our individual lives in such a way that reflects the earth?
In a way that is practical, in which other people can get behind, from any walk of life?
In which they will get behind?

remember to set a timer and schedule this time out.

Why can't I remember? I apparently didn't write any of it down.
Did any of it get expressed in words?
Did I forget... What did I forget? God, Love, please help me remember what I've forgotten... Love, Love I call on you. How can we act differently right now
to change our world?
We can show kindness to others. What does that mean? We can give. How can we give? We can help each other. But how do people help each other when their life doesn't support that? When they aren't in a position to help others?

People can move into a position that allows them to help others. But why would they want to help others? Because we want to live in a better world. We don't want this one. But that isn't enough motivation. We need more. We need more incentive. Inner change will create outer change. We need it to be practical and realistic.
Lets admit that most perspective on a better world where everyone's laughing and singing songs is a bit unrealistic, its not practical in the real world. Such dreams are a bit fantastical, a fantasy, and to some a Disney world of melody and sing-a-long musicals would be its own kind of nightmare.


So we as a collective people all can agree that now is a good opportunity to slow down. I'd like to talk about a little bit of what that really means.
We all know that we need to slow down. But why do we need to slow down? Because we need to care about ourselves. Because we need to take care of ourselves. Because we can't take care of ourselves and others if we're not taking care of ourselves.
So what does slowing down actually mean? It is creating space from the problems in the moment to reassess and reflect on what it is we're doing. It is taking the space to observe ourselves and our lives in a conscious way. And even with no outside influence, that is a hard thing to do! And yet we're always trying to do it.
It's asking ourselves again what it is we want, and what we're willing to do to get it. What compromises we'll make for our comfort and security, what trade offs we'll make for our dreams in order to live in a realistic world.

So lets look at the whole for a moment. In every person's life right now we can see that there are large changes happening. Either it be relocation or jobs ending or any number of circumstances on the surface, we could say that there is an observable constant right now that we can observe that everyone's life is in a state of change, and what the future looks like is a matter of possibility.

Now, possibility is a scary thing. Possibility brings excitement, which also is experienced as anxiety. There is not much more terrifying than not knowing what your future holds, not knowing what tomorrow will look like. Change is scary. It can even be painful, and pain is scary. So we could say that for a lot of people, right now is a scary time.

But once we get past a little bit of fear, we can look at this and see that the possibility opening up in your life is an amazing thing. It is a chance to change course, to find out what you want, to have more. In another sense, what once seemed impossible, is now possible. Imagine that! It's like the bridge that was once uncrossable can now be walked upon. So will we walk across it?

We don't know what we want though. Finding that out can take a lot of searching, learning, experiencing, and reading. I'm not going to break all that down today. But I will make an argument, that what you want is the elusive thing called happiness. And while I won't tell you how to get inner happiness, I'll make this argument. It's going to be a bit easier to be happy if you're living in a world you want to be in.

So what does that world look like? I would say that is a world where people love you, they support you, they help you when you struggle, they are kind to you, they are working together.
Now why would you actually want this?

And how would this actually work?

It's possible to build this life right now.
