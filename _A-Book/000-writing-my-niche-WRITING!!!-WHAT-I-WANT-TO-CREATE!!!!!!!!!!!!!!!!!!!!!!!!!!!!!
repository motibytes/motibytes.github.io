Here's my goal: a custom platform for which i am the best and only in the world
at in writing on, that allows me to write and hone my writing and generate
passive income in a way that no one has done before.
In practical terms this means I have a business model that requires people
come to a website.


I want to bring something new to this world
Present a character, a type of writing, that has never been seen before

experientally exploring the spiritual while being grounded in
practical athiestic explanations..

and yeah. think of the other disciplines ive excelled in mastering. this is no
different. much different because limitless..
==================
Here's what my 'competitors' advantages are over me in terms of having an 'online writing business':
More connections.
Better writing.
More content.
Utilizing current architectures that work (filling articles with words people like, articles that link to other articles, other "social media hacks")
Niche topics and insider knowledge that everyone wants.
More manpower.
Most importantly, multiple projects designed just to generate income, 80% of which will fail.

With all of these assets that I do not have, even having all of them, someone can still absolutely fail 100%.
That puts my odds of success(or fame, I suppose, at somewhere around 0-1%. For me to be successful would then have to be an actual miracle.

So here's my only possible advantages, most that I don't currently have but wish to have.
1. Being unburdened by not copying what others have done, giving room for actual real innovation.
2. Being a real me, a beloved loved character (a.k.a. my business IS me, but this requires a fully unrepressed genuine authentic self which I have seen but which I do not have full access to.)
3. Creating something unique which I love that others will love.
4. Being crazy enough to try.
5. maybe even having higher self helping me out.
6. Fully (re)unlocking an amazing imagination I used to have
7. Becoming fully able to transmit (re)unlocked imagination from the mind out into the physical world (i.e. through something I create) (this is something that I have not done in this lifetime.)

Now let's say I have this, which I don't, and just say all of that adds up to me operating as and creating as a fully realized being. And not severely fucking up somewhere along the way. In the event I have all of these advantages, I'd still put my chances of success somewhere between 0-1%.
=======================

But. Even if I don't fully become who I want to be(the real me as i mentioned before), there are ways that I know I can change that will matter in my future whether I fail or not.
I know that I can over time become a person who works tirelessly, who has extreme levels of focus and motivation and dedication and action, who embraces failure, who uses pain as power, who takes action despite fear. I know that I can become that person because that is mostly based on choices and habits I have the power to control.
So... there's that.

the story is half the fun. perhaps i could use some controversy.. but
not before i have produced things that have value
