it's what you like, what you love. all the writing is finished. you're just the editor now, you hold sharp scissors and they have the power.
just cut through and slim it down and put it together. its kind of a love letter to me.

pour as much of what i love and love into it as i can too.

scattered collection of life observances and principles
