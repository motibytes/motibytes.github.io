I've lost track of time. I've lost the sensation that binds one to the
world. I've detached. The strings holding me against gravity have severed.

My feet lay on the pavement on the corner of OldTown.
A shuttle stops at the stoplight.
The doors open.
She leans towards me and bellows,

> "Aren't you trying to go somewhere?"

# _I don't know._


> "Well. Where would you like to go?"

# _I don't know._

> "Okay then. Do you want to get in?"

# _That sounds good._
<br>

The curbside on OldTown is no place to end up, she tells me.

We discuss the possibility of her bus crashing into a semi.

She gives me a day pass.

She directs me to a restaurant.


## At the restaurant

I talk to the pastor on the phone.

I tell him I need to leave, that something is calling me.

Fear echoes through his voice.

He warns of the work of the devil.

But we know, there's no devil here.


## There's just me,

searching for something outside that can only be found inside.

This I know.

I leave. I go and don't look back.

How melodramatic. _Yes, I can hear you too._

## I'm in a shop.

I found what I was looking for.

the shopkeeper asks me,

> "Are you looking to find love?",

# _I think I've had about enough of that._

> "Well. Sometimes it finds you whether or not you're asking for it."

This I know.

On my return,

in my mind,

I see the shuttle driver.

The doors open.

She asks,

> Did you find what you were looking for?

# Yes. Thank you.
