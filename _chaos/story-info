i don't feel like i could write fiction books as i always wanted to.
but i could just freewrite stories for no other reason than fun.
no reason to overthink them or think about them at all.
now wasn't there a story i wanted to write?

why? because it was fulfilling and fun and it's what made you happy.
and you deserve happiness!

You can just write a little bit? for an hour maybe?
