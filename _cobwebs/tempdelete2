I have an answer like the cross now I can't ignore. I didn't hear it from some hippy lecture, I came to find it on my own.

And I haven't spoken it out loud, but I will eventually. Because every conversation, every single observable phenomenon, everything that happens in this reality, every miracle, every healing, every mention of Christ, all remind me of it every single day.

Once you see it, when you look at other people, when you watch and observe what they do, your heart is always crying out for them.

And you know what you are.

What if it's only possible to love someone when you don't want them to feel the pain you have felt?

Is that based on fear?
