start off by writing chaos for 3 minutes. 

edit all articles in posts.
clean up facebook a bit after a few days, after all engagement is reached
mess with the algorithm.
make it wonder why i'm not engaging, why i'm pulling back, what it needs to do to
get me more engaged.
Instead of it pulling down the attention i get, make it beg for my attention more with more
likes, not less.
then, systematically drop my edited posts according to a schedule.

More importantly than playing with fb,

I want every last square inch of every article on JB to be words I love. Edit
until you love it, or move it to postsgraveyard.

Edit, or write, plenty of do for a while.

aaaaa
