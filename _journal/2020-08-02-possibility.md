Miracles are happening and my prayers are coming true. Suddenly I have never
been in more terror. If I really can hold the power to turn my thoughts into
reality, I am not sure I can handle the consequences of using that power.
Or the consequences of not using that power. There are prayers I've set into
motion that will rip myself as I know myself to shreds. There are pains that
I may open up to that will be unbearable. I am not sure how I will be able
to handle existing if it becomes too much.

The terrifying part of possibility is how much more could be possible if
anything is possible. The cause and effect physical world is understandable
and controllable in its nature. But that is the illusion. The illusion is that
any of it is concrete at all, that the forces that we can see govern the results.
But it is the unseen that creates this world. And the possibilities of the
unseen, are endless, are beyond comprehension. Suddenly they become beyond
the scope of my imagination. Suddenly I am not so big in my world. I become
a tiny speck wielding the power of god.
So I suppose my only option is to trust that the divine source that is love
is unchanging and hope that it does not change on me, because ultimately I am
helpless to its power.
That is what is most terrifying. As I widen the scope to the possibility of what
god might be, to how such a thing works, I can see that it is far more complex
and works in far more mysteries ways than operating in a single way I understand
as 'goodness'. Suddenly god is not based on my feelings of goodness at all.
It is far more alien in nature than that. It is far beyond concepts that I
can recognize. It does not operate with laws and in terms of space or what
could be. It could make anything happen at any moment. Anything is far beyond
what we consider to be possible. It isn't that god could turn water into wine,
it's that god could turn hate into love, gravity into fire. With real possibility,
the possibility allowed by thought, that which is thought, god could change the
rules that define reality themselves. The physical world is the most fragile part
of the whole existence, being the endpoint to all of the laws holding up the rest
of it. Yet with thought..
