rewrite to elaborate on how this is an example of how the physical isn't real, how we push and pull towards others,


When friends don't make time for you, you don't have anything more to learn from them. you meet better people, not to mention you have more time to focus on your passions.
Honestly when you start focusing your time on passions, and focus on where your time is going in general, I've been finding that quality time, moments that are quality, drastically increase.
Another way to say that is it almost seems like the more time I spend on myself or whatever other thing, it's almost as though people start asking for more of my time.
Almost as if, instead of seeking out connection, there is a way that it seems if I care about myself more, people start gravitating towards me.
It's a strange phenomenon.
