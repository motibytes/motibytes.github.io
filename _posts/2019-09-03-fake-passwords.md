Just another idea floating by,

If major websites allowed users to set a secondary, 'fake password'
for their accounts, they could leave it where someone would think to look
for your password.

You might leave this fake password on a note on your desk, in a folder
on your computer, maybe in your safe at home.

In the event that someone attempted to use this fake password, this
would trigger a complete account lockout, preventing them from gaining
access. Far more importantly, the user would know that someone had
tried to gain access to their account. _"Did you try to log in to your account today?"_ would become, _"Someone used your fake password to try to
gain access to your email account. We blocked them."_ This would take away
the websites inability to verify _"Was this really you?"_, and just lock it down.

An advanced method of this would be with several passwords.
1stPa$$W0rd - on my desk
2ndPa$$W0rd - in my car
3rdPa$$W0rd - on my phone
4thPa$$W0rd - In my iCloud
If someone attempted to use one of these passwords, the user would also
know the compromised location.
