In the last few months I've started to think about how I operate, what works
for me, what I believe, and how I will create my future. I came to find
that the conceptual understanding I choose to have of the Universe very much
defines the limitations I set on what is possible. Prepare for liftoff..

1. Background: Hacker
Before any foundation is made I thought back to what it is I do. If _the actions
make the man_, than the man I am is a hacker. I change, I modify, I rework what
I understand again and again until I find what works, to an almost methodical
level. This is the whole game for me.

I hacked my definition of the game itself, that it is not a game to play to win, it is a game to play for fun. I enjoy hacking, and so I enjoy playing the game. The reason for playing is satisfied for me simply by participation.

They say we as people are statues to be chiseled away, to work with
what we're given. And so in a sense, I hack away at myself. I am a difficult person to work with, and that is a light statement. I work with myself until I find which methods will work to get me to do what I want me to do, and to be who I want me to be. I work on modifying the parts of me that do not cooperate with my goals until they become my allies and serve a useful function in playing this game of action, of forward momentum.

I hack the way I live my life, and that is each day. This is a process of refining what works for me to achieve a daily or weekly balance between stability and action. To speak of this balance in a few different ways, the balance between wellbeing and productivity, now and tomorrow, life and legacy.

I hack the way I perceive my world. How I choose to perceive the world affects my wellbeing, my life as it is today. The quality of my life today affects and defines my whole experience, my entire range of memories now, back to the past, and to the future I have not yet seen. The quality of my life today is based on how I perceive the world.
How I choose to perceive the world again also affects the possibilities available to me in my future. It even affects the rate at which I grow and who I will become. So, to play the game is to hack my perception, it is to find the best perception of reality to have the best life I can live.

2. Background: The Niche
Every person has characteristics that are uniquely tailored and can be made use of when applied in a suitable direction. I have realized that one of my nuances is practicality. This practicality I'm speaking of is a
rationalistic type of thinking that is borderline Athiestic. My mind remains grounded and does not stray from the observable, physical world, the shared world we all live in and the logic dictated in this world. A large imagination and intense dreaming for decades necessitated this grounding. For however far out I go, there is a rational part of me that keeps my explorer in check. 

I write about this practicality because it explains the approach I take with me into  
details my approach . the most dangerous game, the game of consciousness.
(experientally exploring the spiritual while being grounded in
practical athiestic explanations..)
beliefs are dangerous.
when entering into spirituality, the line between sanity and insanity ceases to exist. a mind who has
abandoned the concept of sanity itself.
Ideology.
free information is free. i profit.

2. Background: The Game

This game has one challenge that must be worked with above any other. The challenge of time.

one appeal to this niche... some nuances to the game include time, the shortest answers in the fastest amount of time.

The New Model.
cannot control the outside environment
god + quantum

energy.
