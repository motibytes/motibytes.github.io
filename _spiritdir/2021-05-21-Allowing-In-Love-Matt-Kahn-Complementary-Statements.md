This is only for those of you who are familiar with Matt Kahn's works.

I have written a complementary addition to Kahn's "I don't know" acceptance statements. While Kahn's are more focused on ego dissolution and inner growth, these are oriented towards the one on a later stage of the 'path of the heart', whatever that might look like in one's life.

While the focus of these statements is on allowing in divine love, under the surface an important intention to hold is the reader speaking to their heart, for the one who has already established a relationship of trust with their heart.

When working with any mantra such as this, I read each statement three times (or as many times as desired), for words to resonate inside my chest or break something open emotionally inside of me.
I allow thoughts related to these statements intentions to arise around them, then add those thoughts to the mantra as desired.

This process is effective when relaxed and focused on the breath, while sober, without expectation of results, and without trying to gain or do anything except simply acknowledge that you do not fully understand these things that exist beyond your dimension.

In another sense, you are letting go of your limited mental understanding in order to allow space for greater, deeper wisdom and understandings to arise.

If you are reading this and thoughts of losing yourself and letting go sounds terrifying, this may not be for you at this time. I would recommend focusing more on the nature of change, or, how to flow like water.
