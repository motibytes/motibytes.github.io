Wrap me in letters!
Look at I-nsecurity,
cloth me in ink skin,
Grace this rough edge,
Paper Cut!

Flood the old worry,
Drown the Hanged Man!
In come the madness,
the putrid dance of my hand!

What thoughts march I-ndignantly,
An Outrage, my Behest!
Indecent, your eye,
unpermissioned,
unauthorized,
honorless crime.

Violation! Desecration of sacred sight, stir my cup again.

Your tainted mirror, frozen gasp,
pupil warming the throne,

unqualified. Wind tornado, dirt on my table, disturbing my guests,
my unrest.

Unknown glass, protect my food for the sensible one.

Sacred Imitation, Unstained, my catch, beheld.
Cupped flight-ling. Breathe. Leap.

I guess this starts [like all these recent 'poems' or 'inspired writings' as a continuation of Dickinson's feelings of rebellious indignation against what is 'proper' and 'accepted' and 'perfect',
that after hiding inside the pages, the writer invites words to come through free form,
inviting imperfection,
[while a side thought worries that there is a universal sort of corruption may have been invited and the writing truly is ruined. ]

Now here I am in the pages, cuddled up with my indecent words, the outrage I have caused,
and now the observer, others, and witness me there.

Now, when a boy accidentally sees a woman naked, who feels the shame and embarrassment? Often times it is the woman, but more often its the boy who's face is flushed red as he faces her rage.

So the observer sees me, and I return the projection before the judgement of my words is cast, I call out a crime that was uncalled for, how dare the observer look at something that he was not qualified to fully appreciate,  and now, it is the observers fault that the words have become defiled, the mere act of looking tainted them, walked all over a sacred campsite and trashed the place.
I can't remember now but I think I'm stirring my cup again because I'm actually getting a bit of a feeling high on my outrage as well, calling out indignation feels righteous, and im transmuting that kindling righteousness into a burning passion.

I become the target of accusation for a moment again in "Your tainted mirror, frozen gasp, pupil warming the thrown", as there is a filter over my eyes staining my vision,

and I am attempting to blow a wind tornado from lower within until all of the dirt is removed from the picture and when all the dirt is removed I hope that the filter on my vision lifts and that I will be able too look at the immortal unshakable table clearly, [which is not unlike a table found in one of the later Narnia books] and now can invite my guest to partake in the word salad I have prepared,

then I think that I acknowledge that my words are an imitation, a continuation of using dickinson as a muse, but choose to perceive the copy as sacred as well.

Then I hope that by making this choice, the little June bug I've found in my heart, after eating, will take flight in my heart and open me up to that experience of butterflies, light positive feelings.

And note that I who was wrapped up in the letter, and was holding the words, after I took accused the observers eye of indecency, I took on a new role as the protector of the sacred. I've shifted from a vulnerable position in the heart into the hero of what can't protect itself and now here is a sort of newfound resolve, purpose, reason and strength to go on.
