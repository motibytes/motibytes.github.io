In the last few months I've started to think about how I operate, what works
for me, what I believe, and how I will create my future. I came to find
that the conceptual understanding I choose to have of the Universe very much
defines the limitations I set on what is possible. Prepare for liftoff.

## 1. Background: Hacker

Before any foundation is made I thought back to __what it is I do__. If _the actions
make the man_, than the man I am is a hacker. I change, I modify, I rework what
I understand again and again until I find what works, to an almost methodical
level. This is the whole game for me.

I hacked my definition of the game itself, that it is not a game to play to win, it is a game to play for fun. I enjoy hacking, and so I enjoy playing the game. The reason for playing is satisfied for me simply by participation.

They say we as people are statues to be chiseled away, to work with
what we're given. And so in a sense, I hack away at myself. I am a difficult person to work with, _and that is a light statement_. I work with myself until I find which methods will work to get me to do what I want me to do, and to be who I want me to be. I work on modifying the parts of me that are unpleasant until they become my allies in playing this game of action, of forward momentum.

I hack the way I live my life, and that is each day. This is a process of refining what works for me to achieve a daily or weekly balance between stability and action. To speak of this balance in a few different ways, the balance between wellbeing and productivity, now and tomorrow, life and legacy.

I hack the way I perceive my world. How I choose to perceive the world affects my wellbeing, my life as it is today. The quality of my life today affects and defines my whole experience, my entire range of memories now, back to the past, and to the future I have not yet seen. The quality of my life today is based on how I perceive the world.
How I choose to perceive the world again also affects the possibilities available to me in my future. It even affects the rate at which I grow and who I will become. So, to play the game is to hack my perception, it is to find the best perception of reality to experience the best life I can live.

2. Background: The Niche
Every person has characteristics that are uniquely tailored and can be made use of when applied in a suitable direction. I have realized that one of my nuances is practicality. This practicality I'm speaking of is a
rationalistic type of thinking that is borderline Athiestic. My mind remains grounded and does not stray from the observable, physical world, the shared world we all live in and the logic dictated in this world. A large imagination and intense dreaming for decades necessitated this grounding.

I write about this practical nature because it helps explain my approach to the model of understanding the universe that I am working from. In that the game I'm playing is the most dangerous game, the game of hacking consciousness. The entree fee required is to forfeit all that is understood, all that we can see, all that is known to get a better understanding of the mechanical nature of a system, from the limited perspective of being a part of that system. __To explore consciousness today is to move away from the scientific and towards the metaphysical, what we cannot observe and cannot measure.__ What makes this game so dangerous is to explore what is possible, one must look into experiential evidence, patterns that are observable but for which only a  supernatural explanation can be given. The possibility of one's own experience moves an individual away from what the world will believe is possible, what the world will believe is real.

To delve into the metaphysical is to enter into the field of spirituality if one is to find any deeper understandings of consciousness. The issue with this is that anything spiritual is no longer what is considered purely rational, as spiritual doctrines offer supernatural narratives and often isolated conceptions of the nature of reality. These beliefs are dangerous to the rational person because in spirituality, a clear line between sanity and insanity can easily fade away. As it is said, Genius is only genius if it can be understood by others. The rational man is only credible if he remains rational, his rationality cannot change.

In my mind is a rational analytical self that never sleeps. It holds few beliefs. It is from this self that I write. 'Below' that is a learning explorer self that believes in a great many fantastical narratives. With the rational self holding it, it is possible for it to have faith in supernatural ideas, as well as entirely abandon sanity altogether. Such it is that I can believe in much and in nothing at all. That I believe in any concept I state in this writing remains just as much a true statement as it does false.
