'Loss is the Catalyst'

im not reinventing the wheel, just gotta create a simple habit,
the habits become autopilot eventually and carry me..
changing the habit to be one of long term focus as opposed to instant gratification.
The only leisure activity this could include is reading BOOKS. not articles.
loss is his catalyst.

creating self imposed embarrassment by telling others what i will do and will not do works.

Rationalizing that I am writing to hold the light,
not to be successful.
That when others see a pattern of me writing, that I can keep this momentum
going.
trusting god..
the way is always changing..
Changing my environment by getting to the beach.
Creating the workspace with no distractions.

Doing the bare minimum, just getting out what I can today.
I don't have trouble writing when I'm just talking to others..

music..(tool, APC, ME3,
Thinking about time differently..
How..to..take breaks..without stopping..
Switching between writings is what's currently working but seems
unsustainable
pain..
