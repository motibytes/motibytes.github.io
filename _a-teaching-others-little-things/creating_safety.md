yeah. it's a lot to unpack because it's an entire philosophy and i have different parts of it.
Imagine that the alchemist is this chemist who is into the art of refinement. He cultivates, is always in a process of cultivating what he's working on.

There is an understanding that the creative part of you is playful. There's an argument that creativity is play. There's an argument that play is our natural state.
There are arguments that states of flow are in play. No matter how you look at it there is a relationship between a creative part of ourselves and a playful part of ourselves.

Now from another angle, the matrix, the system is afraid of change, power, it's afraid of you getting hurt, it's willing to tell you you're lazy to protect you like a mother hen from the dangers of you being playful. Others and yourself will try to protect you from this danger. But of course you're not a child now so you can protect yourself and you can handle this danger.

Now from another angle, if you want to be creative, you have to access that. If you want to access that, you have to access play. If you want to access play, you need to be in a place in which you can play.

Now we're back at the alchemist, because what you need is to cultivate the place in which you can play. Which means you have to find out what criteria need to be met in order to meet the requirements to define what kind of place that is.

Now we're back at inner growth/ wellbeing/personal growth, because that place is a place of safety.
In a place of safety, we can feel safe enough to access our creativity. That book I mentioned, the first chapter is literally titled "Recovering a sense of safety."

The access to where we need to get to is a space of safety where the creative part of us will come out. So we have to cultivate a place of safety, and asking what a place of safety is, now we have to ask what meets those criteria.
[6:34 AM] The Great Divenie MilsðŸ§žâœ¨: That is a place of still, quiet, space, a space without self or external pressure.
With pressure, we cannot play. The part of us that is creative, it needs to be able to do what is in its nature. Its nature is to explore and investigate and inquire and ponder and wonder and find out and open up and expand,
We can't do those things in an environment that isn't safe enough to do that in.

Not only do we have to be creative,
