On operating at 99999%, I've found what will allow me to do this.


It's allocating time to play. Not agenda focused. Real quality self care time spent without attachment or expectation.

I can heal my mind entirely and train it to be in a constructive creative mode 24/7. More importantly, have the fulfillment it was previously more or less difficult to obtain.
