If you want to become a person who matters in life, 
you need to believe everything everyone tells you.
Listen to everything everyone has to say.
Only then can be sure that everyone agrees with you
and accepts you as who the world wants you to be.
Never make the fool's mistake of thinking for yourself,
as this can only hurt you.
Simply follow what others are doing and you will be fine.
