I want to learn how to interpret reality artfully and experience it, to flow with the unseen forces I can't see, to reach higher and have more worth and love and meaning.
I will have these things, I will learn how to artfully experience reality and reach higher and have more worth and incredible success and meaning and life and love.

Forget everything you know about the world.
Forget your optimism, Age of fear and hate
As long as you follow
As long as you let others control your emotions

As long as you trust the external world and not your inner self, getting comfortable and familiar with you inside..

this world is okay to speak in. It's okay to speak truth. Your truth.
