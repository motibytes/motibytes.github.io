Finally, if you find yourself in the heat of the moment, or
if there’s something that’s really nagging at you, try this
out.
Take something that’s bothered you recently and hold it
in your mind. Maybe it’s your girlfriend nagging you.
Maybe it’s being terrified of talking to that cute girl in
class next to you. Maybe it’s quitting your job.
Distill it into a single sentence, such as, “I feel afraid of
quitting my job.” Or “I feel irritated with my girlfriend.”
Now close your eyes and imagine Bugs Bunny saying it,
while chewing a carrot. Then Mickey Mouse saying it,

while dancing and doing cartwheels. Pretend the
Chipmunks are singing it to you in the form of a
Christmas carol.
Now, turn it into an image, maybe your angry girlfriend,
or your broke ass sitting on the curb. Put that image on a
television screen. Make the colors funny, give yourself a
polka dotted suit. Make your girlfriend’s hair into a
bunch of candy canes.
Make the thought look and sound absolutely ridiculous
in your mind. Take your time and play with it. Try to
make yourself laugh.
After you’ve done this for a minute or two, stop. How do
you feel?
Chances are you feel much better about it and the
negative emotion isn’t nearly as potent as it was before.
