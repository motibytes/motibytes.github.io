## 1. Full Circle

Just live your life.

If there is only one thing you get out of this book, let it be this reminder. There are many stages we walk through in life, with each phase climaxing at a high point where we have learned new concepts that fundamentally reshape our reality, reignite our inner flames, grant us new hope, and fresh clarity on what it means to be alive. The truth is, it's never about reaching that high point.

It is almost comical that the majority of positive self-help material, religions, philosophies, and spiritualities essentially lead towards the same goal, enabling one to live their life, with the difficulties that come with it.
This might seem obvious, but when you come to realize this, you can always breath a sigh of relief, no matter what struggles you're pushing through. The end of the rainbow, whether it be the Buddhist walk or a Christian one, has the same destination. The destination is always the beginning, where an individual realizes that life is beautiful and is meant to be experienced, and that is all. For Christians, the golden ticket lies in a sort of motivating empowerment. That God loves you and created you so that you could enjoy the gift of life, and all that is left to do is live it. For Buddhist or Taoist followers the answer is the same, one who has found Enlightenment is one who sees their life as part of the whole process and chooses to participate in it. New Age teaches us that we have chosen to be here, to show us again that the point of life is to live.
This can be disheartening to hear, because we are in a near constant quest for meaning. We want to find a greater answer, but only because we have not yet found that this has always been the great answer. We will always come to find however, that there, right there, is the meaning we were searching for. This is not to say that the act of questing is pointless or that our searches are fruitless. We do come to learn concepts that help us to get out of our own way and live life with greater appreciation than ever before. This is to say that there is no reason to stress that you haven't gotten to where you're going, to fret that you haven't come to find what you were looking for yet. There's no reason to think that you aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing, fretting that you have not yet found. When you reflect back on your life, you can look back and see that at each stage of life you have persevered, no matter the hardship, failure, confusion, suffering, pain, you always reached a high point where you made it through, and came to understand that life gets better and life goes on. You likely have and will likely again reach new high points where you again are revitalized with the understanding that life is meant to be lived. The warning here might be, don't let your searches keep you from appreciating the experience of living, because the end of the road is to live. It could be said that what the aforementioned religions try to offer is the shortest shortcut to get you to a place where you are able to focus on living your life, in order to maximize the time you are able to spend living it.

No matter what you're going through, just remember that all of the truths you will learn will come back to that understanding. Remind yourself that you don't have to get it all right now, because you eventually will, and when you do get it, you'll realize that you are no more at an endpoint than you are a starting point. It's not about reaching the light at the end of the tunnel, it's all about experiencing a tunnel touched by light. You will find that the meaning of life is to live, so until then, or when you forget, try to keep in mind that whether you're aware of it or not, you're already fulfilling your goal, you no more or less are where you're supposed to get to then where you are right now, you cannot be doing better than you are. You are perfection.

<!-- Reminds me of a man.. a challenged man.

As I sat on a park bench, a man rode up to me on a bike. Without introduction he began spouting off random trinkets of information he had likely gathered from long nights spent on Internet travels. He would ride little circles around on his bike while speaking, then pull round in front of me agin and exclaim, " And that's all you ever needed to know!", and with a look of satisfaction on his face, start pedaling and ride away again.
I can't help feeling like that man, writing this. And that's all you ever needed to know!
It's funny to reflect on because he's so right. I didn't need to know anything he spoke, and that's all I ever needed to know.
