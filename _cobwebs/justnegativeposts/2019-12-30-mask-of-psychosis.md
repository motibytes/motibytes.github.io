I can't watch television. I should not watch television.
My mind is fragile. Characters get attached. They glue to my face
like a sticker that won't scratch off. In my brain exists some kind of rogue
survival program, a routine running in the forefront of the mind that I cannot unplug.
<!-- This is not unlike when I lost it, when I finally snapped and a computer terminal
was permanently embedded into my mind's eye. -->

I'll tell you what this really looks like. Right now, I'm "Joe Goldberg", from the Netflix show "You". The sound of my inner thoughts matches his own.
My inner dialogue matches his warped thinking patterns and perceptions of reality.
I feel logical. I feel I have crystal clear attentive focus and clarity. I feel calculated. These traits are not unlike those of other characters my mind has clung to. <!-- , from Dexter Morgan to Sherlock Holmes.-->

Unfortunately, this feeling of being Joe extends beyond my thoughts. I feel that I am every perceivable aspect of his character. There are good parts. For one, I feel I could write until the end of time. Joe displayed a genius level talent for writing, he simply never exercised it. I feel mildly intelligent, I can't help but wonder if my IQ is locked down to the level my brain imagines his to be. I feel I hold a certain kind of sanity, in the way that he understands the world in a literal and pretty solid way.

From watching Joe be perceived by others as a good man and a
father, I feel that others might be able to perceive me the same way, no matter how damaged I am. I recognize that like Joe, I am damaged and broken and desire to connect with others.

Alas, Joe happens to be a freak. A weirdo. I do not relate my own feelings of being a freak and a weirdo to Joe's. Instead, his unique brand of freak feels that it has attached itself to me. I feel it inside of me. I feel it on my skin. I see with my eyes my body as
grotesque and disgusting as Joe's. I feel his age, the death creeping onto
a man in his late 30's. I feel his weakness, his lanky, skinny body. I feel his toxic masculinity. I am connected with his distaste for others which likely reflects his feelings about himself. His hopes that he can be better are my own. His continual questioning of his own deeper intentions feels right at home. I feel my own rage boiling deep inside me as I could
see it run through his blood. I feel that I match his capacities and scare myself, knowing that I am also capable of the sins he has committed. I feel that I am his hollow, bony, pale white shell, a dead thing devoid of life and soul. I feel devoid of empathy and remorse. I feel his desire. His hatred. His compassion. His power complex.

Nearly everything about Joe is mine. His reality, his body, his feelings. I feel that externally I am his better self, and internally I am his real self, a depraved monster.

I don't feel I share his unique charm externally, and yet internally I am suffocated by the sensation of it. I don't feel I have his uniquely profound insights, and yet I can taste them.

Yet I feel I speak as he would speak. I write as he would write. I cannot escape this prison in my own mind, is something I feel he might say.

There is one benefit to the character of Joe that I feel I will profit from.
The character's insane levels of self-justification causes me to become introspective and critically
question my own self and the lies and stories I use in my life, as I truly hope anyone would.
The thing is<!-- - Joe would totally say, "The thing is", and "totally" - -->, I shouldn't require to have
his ugly face, his piercing eyes as the mental image of myself to be able to reflect on and critically analyze his character.

There is nothing I can do about this psychosis but wait for it to break off from the forefront and become a background part of me as have so many parts  before this.
I question who is underneath this mask and I can only envision a kind of face stealing creature, a demonic entity that masquerades as characters it likes. A thoughtless, voiceless presence that blends into whatever it can get its hands on.

Today I am Joe Goldberg, and I have to watch myself act as I do not wish and speak as I do not speak, while I remain in hiding in the back of the audience. From the stands I get to watch just how much the new mask will change other's opinions of me as they have no idea that my behavior is
related to a fictional character I accidentally got too close to. I will suffer unnecessary self-torment only because <!-- - Hey there, Joe's blame games - --> of this monster trying to protect me.

No, instead, the fear of being seen as such will lead me to withdraw from
the world entirely, lest no one perceive me in a way that I have not
agreed upon. And so I wonder if the true intention of my mind has always
been that from the start, an elaborate attempt to manipulate me into
secluding myself from others so that I might be protected.
