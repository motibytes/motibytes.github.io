Reflecting back on spiritual music once again. There were songs that I once
perceived as darkness in my soul. In my mind they stirred up the quiet whispers of my old demons I do not normally sense in my mind. Over time, these voices no longer arose. I had questioned whether I was becoming darker, acclimating to darkness.

Now, reflecting back, I don't believe the darkness covered my eyes. I believe that
light poured into darkness and my demons scattered away. In the end, there is
nothing to fear.
