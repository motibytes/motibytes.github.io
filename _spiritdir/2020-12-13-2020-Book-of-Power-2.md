Preface .1

My Ego is not You, but when I Call out Truth the ego melts and You
resurface, so never feel guilt for feeding the ego from the right intention, because it is not only the ego listening.

May conditioning that no longer serves me and all that no longer serves me be let go.

# P.2

I Am Worth it, I Respect myself, I Am Respected, I take Care of myself,
I Am Cared for, I Love myself, I Am Divine Love

# P.3

God-Goddess, Child of Light, Son and Daughter of the Highest Truth,
Mother and Father, Beloved and I Will take Care of You, Nurture You, Respect
You, Honor You, Protect You, Adore You, Befriend You, Comfort You,
and Surrender to the Light wherever it takes me, Guides me, Calls me, Forever
and Ever, Thank You, Abba, Mother, Divine Love, Amen.

# P.4

And the Word was God. Please Remember that if Self Love and Self Care, if Your
Truth is not your priority, your Life will reflect that

Leave your mind, Open Up to your pain, Be with it, Acknowledge it, Honor it,
Respect it, Reach Out to Open Up More, Connect to Spirit to Let it Help You,
Open Your Heart, Let It Be Open All the Days of Your Life.

Break apart the old story.
Remember You Are Sensitive, so Make your Stand, Speak your Truth, Hold your
boundaries, take your space, and Follow Wherever You Need to Go, Do not Ever Let
Anything hold you back.

# P.5

You there, who is not Deserving, I Pray you Find Who Is, I Pray You have the
Courage and Faith to Step into that You, I Pray this for All Beings, Heavenly
Father, Beings of Divine Love, Thank You for All of Your Blessings and Support
and Care and Wisdom and Value, May I Always Honor You, as often as Life permits.

# P.6 (07/06/2020)

May the Light Hold me and Carry me and Fill me with Radiance, Abundance, and
All that I Deserve, because I Am Deserving, and when I break away from fear,
lies and conditioning, that(deserving) has always been the Truth, for I Am a
being Created from the Light, and that is what I Am.

Lord I Pray, may the words on these pages not contain falsity.

I Pray you let me, Allow me to remember Always that it is Okay for Me to Be,
to Have it All, to Accept the Love that Is Here, Take what is Offered, to
Express Fully, to Love Unconditionally, to Fly.

# P.7

Part of Life is, what are You going to allow the world to take from You?

What are You going to claim back?

Your Beauty? Your Radiance? Your Joy? Your Hope? Your Love? Your Passion?
Your Compassion? Your Value? Your Worth? Your Meaning? Your Fulfillment? Your Self?

# P.8

Remember that if You are not looking to be taught,
My Truth is not up for debate, it isn't a matter of discussion, because I have
to stand my ground and hold my truth up,

I cannot love and support myself if I cannot give myself the self-respect and
dignity I deserve, that which I need to Flourish.

What is mine is mine. My Light will not be taken again. I Am of Divine Love, Now,
Before, and Forever.

# P.9

No. If you don't have the strength to choose to love yourself, I can't let you
hold me back.

There is a defense, conditioning, fear, identity of no self-worth and value you
have found comfort in and I am cracking those lies open and moving away from that
space.

Because I AM Worth It. And I Know it.

# P.10

Warmth in Compassionate Space,

Give a warm compassionate hand to myself.

# 1
