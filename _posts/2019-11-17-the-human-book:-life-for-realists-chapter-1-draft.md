It's hard to find a reason to write a book. All of the greatest truths, the
secrets to life, it's all in the most simple of statements. It's all the most common sense, the
basics we are continually reminded of. These same truths are manifested throughout each of our stories, reminded by us again and again. Some of us turn to radical religions and methodologies, elevating these truths to a profound mystical level just to convince ourselves and focus so hard on them that we might never forget them.  You'll find these same truths in every walk of life in every culture in history. In the end however, old age and death come to us and we throw our hands up, hold steady to what we've absorbed so far and hope for the best or fear for the worst.

Unfortunately religion and even spirituality can lose its value and become repetition, no longer revealing truth but leaving us in a perpetual limbo, somewhere on the elevator level 46, occasionally rising up to 47. Then, aware that we are not as satisfied as we should be, we decide that we must not be focusing hard enough on our textbooks, that we must have more conviction, more faith, more belief if we are to reach level 47, believing that the story is the point of it all instead of what is found in the story.

Before we might become distracted by them, religions when used properly help us along our way. They provide us memorization techniques for quick access of reminders of basic truths, and also provide us with something far more important, something also found in life experience. This gift is what one could call revelation of truths, when newfound understanding and realization comes to simple words and phrases that have been there all along. This is when a simple common phrase can become an entirely different experience of reality. And this is why these phrases are so widespread, as those who have found their true meaning are sure to share them to all who will listen.

And yet, the information is scattered about all across the globe. For an example of a simple truth without much depth, among the homeless in America you can find nearly every person saying, "You don't talk about Fight Club", or even more commonly, "What were you talking about?". In that world, the value of looking out for another by not betraying each other is not only recognized, it can actually be felt as a type of caring for another that you do not even know. I use this abstract example because it minor and flawed and not among the truths this book is about.

With all these books and religions that cover the same secrets, I have not found a book that lays it out plain as day, without a story to believe in or a code to follow. There is usually an agenda. In other cases, some books carry such profound insights that they can't even be taken in all in one read!

I have not found a book that lays out the simple important truths of life, as a father would bestow upon his daughter, in a manner that is straightforward and without any specific 'conviction' or required belief system. In other words, I aim to write a book that is universally accessible to all walks of life.
And so here is yet another book I will never finish writing.
