While the memory is still fresh. This kid, I asked him,
"You're a computer guy huh?"
Yes, he said.
"Do you fuck with code? Any programming languages?
He knew a little, not a lot. Ableton. music was his forte.

In a group, he told his embarassing stories, in a defense manner.

Later that evening, he let out to me that, "I've lost parts of myself."
Seeing another of my kind, I had no qualm with opening up to him.
He told me about his father, who pursued writing until his stories became reality,
his mental health deteriorated.
We concurred on Source, that we are connected, staring into the abyss, having been through
personal hells, loss of pieces of ourselves, that he was a writer.
He had a year on me, the only difference between us being a more unstable father, less mental health issues himself,
and him using more drugs, and having learned less, <!-- and intelligence.. though who is to say how intelligent he
would be without drugs -->

He felt less alone knowing that there was someone else who shared a similar past and self and story.
I never really know how to respond to that. How many times have I had this conversation now? That I know
there are millions of us. That we are someone's crafted template that is grown off of. With the same
characteristics, motivations, dreams, passions, thoughts, mannerisms, personality. We are
designed this way, programmed this way. We are given this base personality and the same base story and plot for that story to match.
There is a statistical probability for how many of us are born, and how far apart geographically. We aren't all
born in the same city.  There is a small calculatible percentage of us in each town, city, state, country, contenant.
t isn't random, it's pseudorandom. Our creation is fixed to a specific algorithm just as real as the laws of
quantum physics and physics in general.

Chalk up everything in the universe to random chance, accident, that's fine. But the stories and courses of our
lives, there are observable patterns, mathematical operations that can be measured and quantified.
Plots of tragedy and comedy, these are set into motion. While not necessarily individually scripted, the
basis for these scripts is an observable series of prototyping. Our profiles, our histories, they are on some level,
designed. The outcome of these stories is subject to choice and pseudo-random fixed chance, allowing for different
potential possibilities, but at the core this is the work of a maker.

If I were to design a world, I wouldn't want to individually create billions of stories and lives.
No, I would simplify the work, and be excited by the potential of what I had set in motion. I would
design the base profiles of each kind of person and create functions that randomize characteristics and
attributes of these. In computer programming we would call this a function factory. A people factory.
A story factory. An Earth factory. It would be then, that not only are characters like me and Wyatt part of
a base design, but that the planet is also of such design, and that there are planet factories, and even
universe factories. The big bang isn't far off the mark, that there is a start to the program.
<!-- We are just missing some key details, for instance when people were spawned into the planet. -->

I understand why people would want to consciously ignore all of this, that we of a world designed by us,
but I often fail to understand **how** anyone can ignore it, if they really think about it. There's no
mistaking it, theres no other theory or hypothesis that takes into account all of it in such a way.

One important thing for me is that while I believe God may exist, and spiritual realms may exist independent of
one's imagination, that doesn't remove the theory. I see no connection to the designers of this planet to the
spiritual deity that fills me with light and love. I see nothing pointing to them being one and the same.

I don't think we have a fixed destiny. I think that there is a template laid out for a possible and attainable
destiny, and we may choose to lean towards it. Taking back what I just stated about no connection between creator and
God, this would be an exception. It would seem that a spiritual deity would have a destiny for us and lead us towards
it, which would also point towards being the designer of such destiny.

Exploring that line of inquiry.. The way I see it, if the creator was a physical being like us, and set out a
template destiny for us, he might also want us to worship him and glorify him. Say the designer could not reveal
himself, lest we feel like we are in a trap by a person with no more qualifications to control us than we ourselves,
