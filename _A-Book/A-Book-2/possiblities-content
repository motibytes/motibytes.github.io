how can we play with memory?


Either we simply have to open the door, or there are fated moments in which the door is open.
Either way, life definitely works out.

try to imagine that if you change the content of the conversation, you can navigate to other realities.
that the spoken word is the vehicle through which you can travel. Not though effort and doing, but moving to a point in which you awaken that which can move for you.
