I think to abandon hope would be the only real mistake one could make in life
I think maybe, that light IS hope. "Light" is not just spiritual energy,
I think it is the idea that although I cannot see it yet or have any proof of it,
it will be here later. That while I cannot see this idea of love, it exists and
someone else has found it and I will find it, that someone else has found god,
and someday I will find god, that someone else is okay, and someday I will be okay
