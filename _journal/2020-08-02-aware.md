My awareness is growing. It's too much at once, a light blinding me.
Starting to become aware that the feelings I am feeling when I look at things,
when I see others, that it's coming from inside me. That these conversations
people are having on Satan, on God, that they are describing parts of my being.
That all the information coming into my sphere is directly being processed by
my brain. What happens if I could sense the whole world at once?
