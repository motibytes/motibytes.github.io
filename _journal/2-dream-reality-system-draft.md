There's something new I tried out. I have read all the habit reading books and the change your life approaches and they all work for a bit and then suck.
But I figured out what's way easier. I just have two pages. And on one page I write "Dream" and I think of what I would want to do if I was living my best life tomorrow, if I was taking care of myself tomorrow. Maybe journal or create art or go on a run whatever would make me have a better day.
And then the morning comes. And there's this plan of a few simple things I've written yesterday. And there's a feeling like, "Oh. That guy from yesterday gave enough of a shit about me to write this plan for me. " and for some reason it's easier for me to give myself permission to do a couple of things, and my body is easier to move.
