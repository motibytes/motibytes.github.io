I'm just gonna leave the first thought "dilemma" that goes into this here.

If we had equal struggles and we were the same as other people, we wouldn't be different.
Other people might get close to us, but there's a wall, they can't truly relate to us and can't truly understand us because we are different. It is impossible for them to understand you by definition because you're different than them.
They can't understand you because they haven't been through what you have been through.

Being different becomes a core part of identity. It protects us, it makes us unique and special and have some value, but it also means we're alone. Alienated.
The cost of being different is isolation, but the cost of being the same, is a lot more.

But fuck other people, I don't like other people, I don't want anything to do with other people. There's them, and then there's me. They're crazy, they don't get it, they're idiots, they're blind, they're hurtful creatures. If I trust them, I get burned.

And yet that's just one mental process. There's another that says, I want other people. I need other people.
But they are different than me. Because, I am different.

The second dillemma... Is if you were the same, that would mean that there was no method to the madness.. that there was no specific reason for God to put you through hell.. it may have created a beautiful person, but it would really mean that there was no reason for all of your suffering. It would mean that your suffering was without meaning.
And that's a very very harsh and painful conclusion.

But.. the silver lining...
