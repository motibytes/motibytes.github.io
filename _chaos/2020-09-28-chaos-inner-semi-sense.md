Out on the fringes of the unknown, who is he, left alone, what are these, eternal thoughts, rising and reaching for, the next connection, looking over the edge of the painting's border, behind the Aurora, where the lines draw together, where the river falls from nowhere, where the tethers between each heartbeat sing quietly..

Where is the endless grief carried when it hides away, when we turn our sights..does it rest in the black pond in the tranquil garden, screaming into melodies no one will hear from again?
