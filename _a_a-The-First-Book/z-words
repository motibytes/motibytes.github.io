# scattered words

#

If needed talk to yourself in the future in your head, the you in the future 20 years from now, who made it through everything,
Telling you that it all works out.

#

You make them love you for your greatness. Then you let them love you for your flaws.

#

I am with souls that heal as I heal them, help as I help them.

#

My mind creates, my hands heal, my heart connects.

#  my wishes and prayers

Seek until you find the place where where the pain is endlessly letting go and healing faster than time itself.

Seek until you find the place where your breath is so open you can truly breathe again.

This world is okay to speak in. It's okay to speak truth. Your truth.

#

I support giving yourself permission to be the real you, however you are.

#

I want to learn how to interpret reality artfully and experience it, to flow with the unseen forces I can't see, to reach higher and have more worth and love and meaning.
I will have these things, I will learn how to artfully experience reality and reach higher and have more worth and incredible success and meaning and life and love.
