cbd kicked in paranoia pretty hard. This has been one of the best opportunities for inner work i've had in a while.

 started feeling my mind go towards paranoia and negatives... I tried a new technique and said "I'm not paranoid, I am feeling paranoid" and started to observe these feelings and minor psychosis(a.k.a my perception of how the world outside of me feels), and I was able to see that more than likely most of what I was experiencing was likely a minor loss of control, allowing for more insecurity and negatives to come in with my defenses lower. I was able to rationalize that to be more insecure is just to be more vulnerable and that it's okay to be vulnerable. I thought that perhaps besides minor ego dissolution I was also becoming more relaxed, and this was triggering a fear of stillness. I could see that usually I would enter into this relaxed state of stillness if I was being held by another, and what was missing was a feeling of protection. Again, I thought "It is okay to be vulnerable". I started to accept this level of stillness and hold myself in this state, and began consoling my inner child,

and when i settled into it I actually feel super calm super relaxed and kinda high, and focusing on my heart for a while began to break the psychosis.
