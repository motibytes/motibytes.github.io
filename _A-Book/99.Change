Message: we get everything we want               <--

I think we do get what we want.
And that why we don't change, is because we don't want to.
The first problem I've found is .. what it would take to change, isn't always what we want. It's not actually who we want to be. I care about animals but I don't want to work at the zoo. I like dogs but I don't want to be a dog person all over my Instagram account. I want to talk to people but I'm not willing to start riding bikes in my city to join them. Because I don't like these masses of normal people that have dogs and are hiking and biking.
That sounds boring to me.

And I can pretty much guarantee you I will never spend time in my life riding a bike. But you know, at some point I think I will get a German Shepherd, because of the benefit having that companion would bring to my life.

What we say we want and what we actually want are usually very different. Pretty much everything we say we want and don't have has a lot less to do with our ability to do so, and a lot more to do with the time and effort we wouldn't want to put in to get it, especially if the thing to get or person to become is mundane.

And that's disheartening but only specifically on what we're focused on, because fleeting ideas aren't what we really want
