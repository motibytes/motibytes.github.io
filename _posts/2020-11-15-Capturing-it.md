- Capturing It - 
I find myself captivated in the attempt to fathom what we are. The miracle visible
at every given moment, that we are truly nothing less than the fullness of being.
We are as human, the expression of every possibility, from weakness to greatness,
we can experience scaling being fantastic and mundane, from depravity to divinity.

We are often striving for better, searching for greater, needing to be okay.
We shy from uncertainty, fragility, despair, torments and sufferings, heartaches
and cruelties.
It is often easy to believe that we would always be okay if we could hold onto one
familiarized state. Our thoughts say, if we always felt this one way, then we'll be okay forever.
And yet while we may try to build ourselves up to condition to such a state such that we
 never fall again, we can surely expect to return to and navigate through every possible state of being as long as we are alive.

I cannot begin to appreciate such a miracle. I often take comfort in knowing that
I am part of the whole being of humanity that is temporarily witnessing an aspect
of it from a personalized view, every imperfection as equally lovable as you would
love the whole of your soulmate. You don't love them less for having scars. You don't
love someone's shoulder less than the elbow because it is simply one body, as it is.

My captivation is in that the beauty of being is always there to be found if it is
searched for by the one who has the eyes to perceive it, most often the harder it is
to find, the quieter one must become for it to come to light.

To me the most beautiful is the most elusive, the most hidden, only found in the
roughest of people, the hardest
of times, the strife of strifes, the thickest of fields, the darkest of
nights, the brightest of lights, the strongest of sorrows. It is often near
silence or silence itself, amidst the orchestra of life.

It feels as though to begin to express the feeling of wonder of this beauty,
that if I begin to speak of it, to focus my gaze on it too intently, it might
begin to vanish. I can only hope to learn to hold it softly that the wonderment
grows into a mass that will be so familiar that it is never far from view.
I feel my greatest regret could never be to fail or take the wrong path or to
make the wrong choices, my only greatest regret would be being and not being,
 killing that sacred essence, that undying spark. I could only regret to try to
 hide from being, or attempt to choose one part of it and deny the other.

Imagine loving someone's shoulder and not their elbow! Imagine trying to be less than
the fullness of being alive!
