People struggle to connect. It almost seems
that the more they communicate, the more isolated they feel.

This world is not communicating because this world is not listening.
We think that if we say more, if we act differently,
that is how we will be acknowledged, how our voices will be heard.

# Yet, the world doesn't need more voices.

People need someone to listen.
When we listen, a strange phenomenon occurs. The less one speaks, the more others will open up. They stop talking about the weather. They don't attempt to force a meaningless interaction. They start to open up.

Perhaps when listening, you clear space for another to think.
They stop feeling like you are waiting for your turn to talk.
They start to trust you, for no reason other than that they can tell
that you are focused on them, that the conversation is for them and
not for yourself. Listening can make them feel safe enough to express themselves.

The conversation is no longer a mandatory socially correct engagement.
It actually flows naturally. The interaction never ends awkwardly, because it ends when it is ready to end. Lingering in the air is a mutual, unspoken sensation of satisfaction, perhaps of a deeper connection, that comes only when it feels like the moment
**mattered**. Whether it mattered or not, remembered or not, maybe is not
for us to know.
