a good reminder. For me it was realizing that it would have been impossible for me a few years ago to know what I know now, just as it's impossible for me now to know what I'll know a few years from now 😛
that helped me realize that no matter what wrong way I think I go in the moment... yeah.. we just do the best we can, and leave as many good seeds planted along with...my path of destruction and fire

Perfect...i believe that too...when we know better we do better...in a few years what i hold to be true will have been a mere glimpse of the full understanding 😊
