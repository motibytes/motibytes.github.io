My thoughts have been, I would never surrender to God. I want what I want.


I want to live the life I want to live. Even if I'm doing what God wants, I am
doing it on my own terms. Because I have a conviction. Because I care about people
and myself and if given the chance I would kill God myself if it was for the sake
of what I care about. Because if saving what I cared about meant being tortured in
fear and death, words that go far beyond words, I would do it. I've already done it
once. It might not be bearable but I would make the choice to do it again.

I can feel that. The attachment to that ego. I can start to see it now, and see where
my logic falls apart. If I care that much, if that is what truly matters to me, and I
know of my own shortcomings and lack of awareness, and I know that there is something
greater than me that has that power,
if I am willing to do anything for that conviction, than I must let go of that attachment.

I can't want what I think I want.

I can't live the life I think i want to live.

I can't do it on my own terms.

I have to get the fuck out of my own way.
