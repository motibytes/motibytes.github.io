(ADDITIONALLY) 
and you may not agree with this opinion, but i will still share it..

For fucking real.. the way I see it... As far as I'm aware I've got one shot in this videogame so it's in
 my best interests to absorb and not reject any information that comes my way, and to seek out the creme
 of the crop best information that the world I'm experiencing has produced.

And like ... At what cost? If others say I can't or shouldn't have this, what is it worth for me to
believe them?  What is it worth for me to have been wrong listening to them and not accessing what was
there for the taking?
