But I was able to get into it with him about what cursing would mean,
the ends justify the means,
That if Cursing is the last resort, it's also the most effective tool,
which makes it a slippery slope, that  logically one should never bless others
 and spend all of their time cursing everyone to make the most amount of change
  in the shortest amount of time.

He said he had thought about this and concluded that this would be the rational
 case, but he found that "cursing doesn't work all of the time" so he didn't head
 that direction.
