An experience I don't want to forget. I'm talking to a man, and I tell him,
"You have a huge light in you. You know that, right? Yeah. I already know you know that."

And of course he knows it.

I've been telling him about how he's okay, that the past isn't here, that he can do anything he wants right now, encouraging him to be creative, reminding him in words I can't bring to mind now that the only thing he could ever do wrong is not love more. This is semi-typical banter for me, and yet some of my own words are getting through,
not to him, but getting through to me. In the meantime he's waking up to this, and remembering what he really should be doing and what he will be doing and how it will affect the lives of others whether they realize it or not. While we're exchanging these words, I'm starting to taste that scent of
a fragrant essence that is lighter than air. I'm starting to remember this sensation when it really sinks in that, it really is all okay, when it isn't just words anymore, it's the truth, the only truth there could ever be, because you know the only thing that matters is that you are here to love this moment.
Those little celestial sparkles of possibility start to electrocute the air, charging up the spaces in between the connections that bind molecules, the loving familiarity of this tangible, almost physical perfection.

And now I look at him and I say these words, that he is a bright light. I say them with an urgency, a necessity, a conviction, a yearning, a plead, in unformulated thought that is crying 'Please, please hear me! I am reaching out, you have to know, I love you! You matter so much, please see that. Please see how worth loving you are. Please see how amazing and beautiful you really are, my heart cries out in agony for you to bear witness to this with me. Please look past these rough thick physical misinterpretations of structured impersonal language to listen to what I am trying to communicate under the surface. Please feel what it is I truly mean for you to hear. Thank you for being such a bright light, thank you for your existence! Thank you for existing!'

Perhaps an exchange of true communication occurs, where he sees that I am reaching out, past my own insecurities and fears, beyond my own walls to tell him what I am afraid he may reject me for, but that I care about him enough to speak.

And then, reality changes...in progress..
