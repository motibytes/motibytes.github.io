Life is theater, this is the story, I am the character in my own play. 
<!-- meta?
why am i afraid of saying this? -->

#

I am with souls that heal as I heal them, help as I help them

#

My mind creates, my hands heal, my heart connects

#

seek until you find the place where where the pain is endlessly letting go and healing faster than time itself
seek until you find the place where your breath is so open you can truly breathe again
this world is okay to speak in. It's okay to speak truth. Your truth.
