imo in my experience, the deeper into self you go to plant seeds, those are the ones that really take root and grow

and that's why we all know praying at the catholic church doesn't work.
"oh god please give me new toyota" doesnt work

its on the surface, there's nowhere for that seed to take roots

surface level thought will eventually affect you though, if you listen to the same song for many years it will change you a bit but not much
but even surface level thought will change you if you pursue it
because you are now moving in that direction of thought


the prayers that work are lined up
