I am of one soul and it (has been) once was tainted black,
No memoirs beware for, I have them taken back,
I've seen the ghouls who cry dressed in their bloody robes,
I've had to close my heart to tame their undead souls,

I've seen your lines of scars infected with my past,
with showers of my sparks lost never to come back,
I see lovers turn back time and quickly hide away,
like a newborn orphan, it just happens ev'ry day,

I look inside myself and see the masses attack,
I see my heart torn I must have it painted back,

I look inside myself to see my heart has cracked,
the structures tearing up, i never can turn back,
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away,


quickly find to say
