Don't you know who you are? You're a fucking reality hacker. Game this shit.

#

I want to learn how to interpret reality artfully and experience it, to flow with the unseen forces I can't see, to reach higher and have more worth and love and meaning.
I will have these things, I will learn how to artfully experience reality and reach higher and have more worth and incredible success and meaning and life and love.

#

If needed talk to yourself in the future in your head, the you in the future 20 years from now, who made it through everything,
Telling you that it all works out.

#

You make them love you for your greatness. Then you let them love you for your flaws.

#

Forget everything you know about the world.
Forget your optimism, Age of fear and hate.
As long as you follow.
As long as you let others control your emotions.
As long as you trust the external world and not your inner self, getting comfortable and familiar with you inside.

Your window of opportunity to break out of the mindset of your society is drawing to a close.

If you don't, you will be your own worst enemy. One day you might blink and have a glimpse that you became everything you once stood against and there will be no--

#

Life is theater, this is the story, I am the character in my own play.
<!-- meta?
why am i afraid of saying this? -->

#

I am with souls that heal as I heal them, help as I help them.

#

My mind creates, my hands heal, my heart connects.

#

Seek until you find the place where where the pain is endlessly letting go and healing faster than time itself.

Seek until you find the place where your breath is so open you can truly breathe again.

This world is okay to speak in. It's okay to speak truth. Your truth.

#

I'm not actually afraid of death when I recognize myself as a unique identity that will die. It makes me sad, but that sadness is part of the value of this.

#

I'm not a rollercoaster anymore, I'm more of a slot machine now, and every once in a while I hit the jackpot.
