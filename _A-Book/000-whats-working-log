creating embarrassment by saying out loud to others what im going to do works.
havent turned on the tv yet.

been writing for a bit. the resistance is fading. my heart is beginning to well
up with 'primordial' pure raw energy.

going well, changing environment to the ocean helped the focus.
complete elimination of fb, tv, media, is forcing to goal.
having a few articles organized is allowing me to jump between them.
Knowing that if I don't do this I'll be looking back at the decision maker seems
to increase my drive to focus.

starting to write and the pain opens in my heart again. what to do with it?
its coming from my facebook addiction, isn't it?

09/?
went to beach, wrote for 20 mins
returned home, jumping between a few things for a couple of minutes
