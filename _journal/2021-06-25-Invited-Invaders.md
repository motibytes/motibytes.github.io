Wrap me in letters!

Look at I-nsecurity,

cloth me in ink skin,

Grace this rough edge,

Paper Cut!

<br>

Flood the old worry,

Drown the Hanged Man!

In come the madness,

the putrid dance of my hand!

<br>

What thoughts march I-ndignantly,

An Outrage, my Behest!

Indecent, your eye,

unpermissioned,

unauthorized,

honorless crime.

<br>

Violation! Desecration of sacred sight, stir my cup again.

<br>

Your tainted mirror, frozen gasp,

pupil warming the throne,

<br>

unqualified. Wind tornado, dirt on my table, disturbing my guests,

my unrest.

<br>

Unknown glass, protect my food for the sensible one.

<br>

Sacred Imitation, Unstained, my catch, beheld.

Cupped flight-ling. Breathe. Leap.
