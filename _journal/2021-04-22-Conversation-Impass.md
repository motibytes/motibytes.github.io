Brother says, you already know what I believe. You already know everything I think.
You know what I say doesn't change. So I don't see how our conversations are conducive,

I said to him, I see what you're saying, and it might be true that I know what you're going to say.
But, you don't know what I'm going to say. What I'm going to say is always changing.

What I say in the conversation is a variable that is still changing.

This less than a minute conversation shocked me.
My brothers awareness of my knowledge of his thoughts was not what I expected. This sounded like the kind of
dialogue I would imagine in my head, and it matches the way I think internally.
This exchange captured where we stood as people, our mutual awareness of our ultimate impass,
our awareness of each other, the difference between us that I have long thought and not articulated out loud.


When I said this to him, I felt like I really saw us as characters in this play. And I feel like what I said, he
understood something on a much deeper level than I am aware of.
Perhaps he understood why I choose a path of change. I do not know.

What I do know is that my words, "But you don't know what I'm going to say" were multilayered.
