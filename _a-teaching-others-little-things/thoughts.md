if you enter a state of mind in deep meditation, and then fill in that empty space with good thoughts

that would be nearly the same as hypnosis

you might even call hypnosis a guided meditation

imo in my experience, the deeper into self you go to plant seeds, those are the ones that really take root and grow

and that's why we all know praying at the catholic church doesn't work.
"oh god please give me new toyota" doesnt work

its on the surface, there's nowhere for that seed to take root, its as effective as me saying may god strike me down with lightning in this very moment and kill me

its just a passing thought

we're protected in this way from fucking up our whole existence

surface level thought will eventually affect you though, if you listen to the same song for many years it will change you a bit but not much

thats why we sometimes laugh at people listening to rap music, they're trying to wear these surface level thoughts of these ideas, that they're hard and tough, but its only on the outer layer its not reflected from the  inside

but even surface level thought will change you if you pursue it

because you are now moving in that direction of thought

if you think about money all the time your life will go in a direction focused on money, your actions will be about money

so ask what happens if you worry all the time

interesting to think about that trance is like a lullaby..(edited)

i heard a hypnotist say once she was like a spider catching people in her web

the web was weaved of thoughts that she was leading one to the next and interlacing and manipulating in such a way that the victim could not see how they were being directed

part of the reason we're all under a global spell of sorts, all sleeping

because our thoughts are always following these same patterns if we're normal

echoing echos of echos upon echos

seems that a good poet or storyteller also leads the reader in this way

and that an argument is a thought path to lead you to a predetermined conclusion

but how much more interesting that you cannot make a person think for themselves, you can guide them to the idea but only they can do that

i find this fucking fascinating
