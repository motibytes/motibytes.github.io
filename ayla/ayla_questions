Ayla,
I have noticed that you share a world view, purpose, and a caring of what you value
that I have not seen often expressed in clarity, that I believe is captured in your words right here,
"Once you free your sight
Once you be for life.

We are.."

(That purpose reminds me of one of my own reminders to myself, a hidden treasure I store in the source code at the top of all of my websites,
at view-source:https://sorcerawr.com/  or seen this image https://imgur.com/a/tlJiU85 )

I can see that you sing not to others but instead directly to your own precious spirit,
that you desire to and will express all that you are, to be shaped as clay by the potter as you shape yourself and integrate
and embody all of your being and give yourself to the heart that you hold. I'm summarizing quite roughly of course.

I have wondered, what is any common denominator that sets apart a person with this difference in raison d'etre among a crowd?
And I have identified at least one common factor. I noticed that at the top of your list of influential people is
Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s, who researched the female archetypes. The archetypes are actually and surprisingly
a quite rare focus in this world.

At the peak of my fascination of hard study is 'King, Warrior, Magician, Lover', the study of the male archetypes.
The many others I have shared this with have not seemed to share in this interest. It seems that to be interested in this,
perhaps one must hold the concept that perhaps they are one ancient being rediscovering themselves once again.

I would just like to ask, in general, what do you think of these archetypes? What is your perspective on them, or how have you
used them in your life?

Please note that I am not accrediting any measure of your value to simply having studied archetypes, as I see in you
simply that there is a beautiful person inside and expressed outside that you did not and will never allow this world to destroy.
