Thoth Chapter 5: ---------------------------------------------------------------

Fell from the Light into the darkness,
some who had risen to heights among men.
Proud they became because of their knowledge,
proud were they of their place among men.
Deep delved they into the forbidden,
opened the gateway that led to below.
Sought they to gain ever more knowledge but
seeking to bring it up from below.
He who descends below must have balance,
else he is bound by lack of our Light.
Opened, they then,
by their knowledge,
pathways forbidden to man.


Thoth Chapter 4: ---------------------------------------------------------------
He who would follow the pathway of wisdom,
#open must be he to the flower of life,
extending his consciousness out of the darkness,
flowing through time and space in the ALL.
Deep in the silence,
#first ye must linger until at last ye
are free from desire,
##################free from the longing to speak in the silence.
##################Conquer by silence, the bondage of words.

#Then lie ye down in the darkness.
Close ye your eyes from the rays of the Light.
#Centre thy soul-force in the place of thine consciousness,
#shaking it free from the bonds of the night.
#Place in thy mind-place the image thou desireth.
#Picture the place thou desireth to see.
#Vibrate back and forth with thy power.
#Loosen the soul from out of its night.
#Fiercely must thou shake with all of thy power
#until at last thy soul shall be free.

####Speaking with music, singing with color,
flame from the beginning of Eternity's ALL.
Spark of the flame art thou, O my children,
burning with color and living with music.
############List to the voice and thou shalt be free.

###Consciousness free is fused with the Cosmic,
###One with the Order and Law of the ALL.
Knew ye not man, that out of the darkness,
Light shall flame forth, a symbol of ALL.

##################################Mighty SPIRIT of LIGHT that shines through the
##################################Cosmos, draw my flame closer in harmony to thee.
##################################Lift up my fire from out of the darkness,
##################################magnet of fire that is One with the ALL.
##################################Lift up my soul, thou mighty and potent.
##################################Child of the Light, turn not away.
##################################Draw me in power to melt in thy furnace;
##################################One with all things and all things
##################################in One, fire of the life-strain and
##################################One with the Brain.


.....
child of the Infinite Cosmic Light.

#Know ye, O man, that all space is ordered.
#Only by Order are ye One with the ALL.
#Order and Balance are the Law of the Cosmos.
#Follow and ye shall be One with the ALL.

Flashed forth my soul through infinity's beauty,
far through space
#######################I flew with my thoughts.

Follow ye ever the path of wisdom.
Only by this can ye rise from below.
Ever man's destiny leads him onward
#into the Curves of Infinity's ALL.

Traveled I through the space-time,
knowing my soul at last was set free,
knowing that now might I pursue wisdom.
Until at last, I passed to a plane,
hidden from knowledge,
known not to wisdom,
extension beyond all that we know.

Thoth Chapter 3: ---------------------------------------------------------------
#Wisdom cometh to all her children
#even as they cometh unto wisdom.

####The wise man lets his heart overflow
####but keeps silent his mouth.
O man, list to the voice of wisdom;
list to the voice of light.


#Follow thine heart during thy lifetime.
#Do thou more than is commanded of thee.
#When thou hast gained riches,
#follow thou thine heart,
#for all these are of no avail if
#thine heart be weary.
#Diminish thou not the time of
#following thine heart.
#It is abhorred of the soul.

Knowledge is regarded by the fool as ignorance,
and the things that are profitable are to him hurtful.
He liveth in death.
####It is therefore his food.

If thou be great among men,
#be honoured for knowledge and gentleness.

Silence is of great profit.
#An abundance of speech profiteth nothing.
Exalt not thine heart above the children of men,
lest it be brought lower than the dust.

#for a man is a fire burning bright
#through the night;
never is quenched in the veil of the darkness,
never is quenched by the veil of the night.


Reach ever upward, O Soul of the morning.
Turn thy thoughts upward to Light and to Life.
Find in the keys of the numbers I bring thee,
light on the pathway from life unto life.

#FIVE is the master, the Lord of all magic -
#Key to The Word that resounds among men. (part of me?)
Meditate on the symbols I give thee.
Keys are they, though hidden from men.

#where do name and form cease?
Only in consciousness, invisible,
an infinite force of radiance bright.
The forms that ye create by brightening
they vision are truly effects that follow thy cause.


Man supports himself only on that which resists.
So Earth must resist man else he existeth not.

first divine the material from the immaterial

If one cometh unto thee for council,
let him speak freely,
that the thing for which he hath
come to thee may be done.
##If he hesitates to open his heart to thee,
##it is because thou, the judge, doeth the wrong.

#Be thou not proud, O man, in thy wisdom.
Discourse with the ignorant as well as the wise.

#Keep thou not silent when evil is spoken for Truth
like the sunlight shines above all.
He who over-steppeth the Law shall be punished,
for only through Law comes the freedom of men.


Thoth Chapter 2:

#Now again I tread the path downward,
#seeking the light in the darkness of night.
Hold ye and keep ye, preserve my record,
guide shall it be to the children of men.

Then spoke I:
#O, great master,
#let me be a teacher of men,
#leading then onward and upward until they,
#too, are lights among men;
#freed from the veil of the night that surrounds them,
#flaming with light that shall shine among men.
Spoke to me then the voice:
#Go, as yet will. So be it decreed.
#Master are ye of your destiny,
#free to take or reject at will.
#Take ye the power, take ye the wisdom.
#Shine as a light among the children of men.

Then spoke my guide, the voice of the master:
#See your own soul as it grows in the light,
#free now forever from the Lord of the night.

I, Death, come, and yet I remain not,
for life eternal exists in the ALL;
only an obstacle, I in the pathway,
quick to be conquered by the infinite light.
#Awaken, O flame that burns ever inward,
#flame forth and conquer the veil of the night."
Then in the midst of the flames
in the darkness grew there one that
drove forth the night, flaming, expanding,
ever brighter, until at last was nothing but Light.

Then spoke a voice, mighty and solemn, saying:
#"These are lights that are souls among men,
#growing and fading, existing forever,
#changing yet living, through death into life.
#When they have bloomed into flower,
#reached the zenith of growth in their life,
#swiftly then send I my veil of darkness,
#shrouding and changing to new forms of life.
#Steadily upward throughout the ages, growing,
#expanding into yet another flame,
#lighting the darkness with yet greater power,
#quenched yet unquenched by the veil of the night.
#So grows the soul of man ever upward,
#quenched yet unquenched by the darkness of night.

#Each surrounded by its dim veil of darkness,
#yet flaming with light that could never be quenched.
Coming and going like fireflies in springtime,
filled they with space with Light and with Life.

Oh, master of darkness,
guide of the way from Life unto Life,
before thee I bring a Sun of the morning.
Touch him not ever with the power of night.
Call not his flame to the darkness of night.
Know him, and see him,
one of our brothers,
lifted from darkness into the Light.
#Release thou his flame from its bondage,
#free let it flame through the darkness of night."

Darker than darkness sat the great figure,
dark with a darkness not of the night.

one in one purpose, working together,
bring of Light to the children of men."

Approach ye ever the infinite Wisdom,
ever before thee recedes the goal.

One step thou has gained on the long pathway upward,
infinite now is the mountain of Light.
Each step thou taketh but heightens the mountain;
all of thy progress but lengthens the goal.

Choose thou thy work, for all should must labor,
never be free from the pathway of Light.

Mighty and strange, they,
veiled with their power,
silent, all-knowing,
drawing the Life force,
different yet one with the
children of men.
Aye, different, and yet One
with the Children of Light.

# He who by progress has grown from the darkness,
# lifted himself from the night into light,
free is he made of the Halls of Amenti,
free of the Flower of Light and of Life.
Guided he then, by wisdom and knowledge,
passes from men, to the Master of Life.

There in the circle from aeon to aeon,
sit the Great Masters,
living a life not known among men.
There in the Halls of Life they lie sleeping;
free flows their Soul through the bodies of men.
Time after time, while their bodies lie sleeping,
incarnate they in the bodies of men.
Teaching and guiding onward and upward,
out of the darkness into the light.

Deep in the Halls of Life grew a flower, flaming,
expanding, driving backward the night.

"We are they who were formed from the space-dust,
partaking of life from the infinite ALL;
living in the world as children of men,
#like and yet unlike the children of men."

Builded they then the Halls of Amenti,
that they might dwell eternally there,
living with life to eternity's end.

seeking to free from the bondage of darkness
those who were bound by the force from beyond.

Thoth chapter 1 :
Then having drunk deep of the cup of wisdom,
I looked into the hearts of men and there found I
greater mysteries and was glad.
For only in the Search for Truth could my Soul
be stilled and the flame within be quenched.

Other chambers I built and left vacant to all seeming,
yet hidden within them are the keys to Amenti.
He who in courage would dare the dark realms,
let him be purified first by long fasting.
Lie in the sarcophagus of stone in my chamber.
Then reveal I to him the great mysteries.
Soon shall he follow to where I shall meet him

Preserve ye and keep ye the command of the Dweller:
Lift ever upwards your eyes toward the light.

Know my commandments,
keep them and be them,
and I will be with you,
helping and guiding you into the Light.
Now before me opens the portal.
Go I down in the darkness of night.
