I chose not to engage in part of my morning routine and looked observed the feeling evoked from doing it instead, the feeling still arose without doing it, being aware that my body was trying to feed on an addiction of familiarity and a patterned state,
it broke me out of the reactive state back into the possibility state, my mindset cleared, any negative thoughts or feelings disappeared, any hangups, resistances, stresses dissolved, the slight quiet signal whisper of "must do something or else, panic, panic" left me in peace.
