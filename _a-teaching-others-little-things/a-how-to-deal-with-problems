easiest secret in the world when dealing with problems btw, like 'how do i deal with anxiety'

1. Set the intention to figure out how to deal with problem, write it down somewhere
2. Admit to yourself you don't know how to solve the problem right now
3. Trust that you'll find the answers to deal with the problem



they will either appear in front of you or fall from the sky or you will end up absent-mindedly looking into it or they will just drop into your head.
it's magic.
