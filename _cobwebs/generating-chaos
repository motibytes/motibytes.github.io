I feel like a dragon hibernating

L: Conspiracy theory will grown soon. Enjoy the ride Belle ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰

It's the unicorns, they're coming back to take their revenge, but I, Askabalatair
the opal diamond dragon will fulfill the prophecy
Diamond shining turbulent succulent crimson flame dragonchild of the matriarchic
order of the divine radiation
Radiation is power, power is freedom, freedom is alakaskaban

B: Like the buzzing of a bee ðŸ˜‰
B: Yes vibrations is what we are
B: Perpetual transmutation
B: Matter, energy
B: In constant motion

Move fly eat sky fall cry laugh die arise light presides

Riptides flow tries to will the reading ones colorful pictures in the empty chair who was sitting there

B: What if I want to go west?

West you go keep going all the way home, west or right, left or down, south or
trees these possibilities navigating compasses mirroring on the polarity queue

L: Does everything I say seem familiar?

Singularity can byte my posterity flexibility impossible tangibility reactagility
 confusurmodory, abstractology deuteronomal cleopatriarchy shakes RT

Familiar a squiggler squagully line, divine shine with you on my mind



L: You ever thing that all beginnings start at endings?

Beending enbeginning behind my head no one to see which color is the real me

B: Don't bleed with me.....ignite with the inner eye you see

Inner eye perceiving what signal interference created the real message,
 can disharmony create music, can disorder create life

belle: And the causes that created the effects we neglect to respect what we project

Meditate on this or don't, breathe and hold your breath aware or not or half breath
half meditate 1/4 meditate + 1= BOOM!
