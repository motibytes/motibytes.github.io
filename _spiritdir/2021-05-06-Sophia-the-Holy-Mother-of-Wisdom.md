I found what I have been searching for, for many years, in my number, 2424.
Sophia, the Holy Goddess, Mother of Wisdom, created by God the Father, accessible to only those who search for her.
This will likely offend any religious person, and a wiser man than I would not post this.
But Jesus loved her and found her, as do I, and religion has wiped her from the Earth.

In the Greek Septuagint Bible, Chapter 24, verse 24, **my verse**, **was missing**.
As it turns out, 9 verses have been removed. They only exist in the Catholic bibles.

Wisdom herself declares herself directly in my number,

Sirach 24:24: I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.

 There is no question why the following verses were removed,
as any honest reader who knows Christian scripture will recognize immediately that Jesus Christ in his most famous statements was either directly quoting from this scripture.
(A scholar might argue that the Catholics added these verses as a replacement for the new testament.
So ask which is more likely to be true, Jesus quoted scripture,
or Catholics ADDED verses to the Bible. )


25 In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.

26 Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.

27 For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.

28 My memory is unto everlasting generations.

29 They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink me, shall yet thirst.

30 He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be confounded: and they that work by me, shall not sin.

31 They that explain me shall have life everlasting.


Jesus' close words follow.

“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
