I am not sure which I am afraid of more, not having a destiny,
or having a destiny beyond that which I have the ability to hold on to.

I feel the possibility exists that my life might change so rapidly that it becomes unrecognizable to me.

If I were on top of the world, truly on top of the world, I fear that I would not be able to rationalize my life. I would be in an unfamiliar world, one that I do not understand. I can see myself being suspended in a perpetual state of disbelief, continually trying to comprehend that my life was real. This is why we run from possibility. This is why we run from the unknown.
