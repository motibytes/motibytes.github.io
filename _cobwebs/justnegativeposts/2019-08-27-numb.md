Don't read this one.

The one with a hollow heart, that likes to watch movies and numb out, float out and coast forever and ever.

I'm not unhappy and I don't need happiness.

I love indifference, to not be or be, to not be anything at all,
just me, just here.

I love melancholy, I love reflection, I love solace.

I love the void. I am the void.

I come out after the one who feels insecure and unsafe.

I am safety and protection.
