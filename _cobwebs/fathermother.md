Father planted his seed in me, and you I grown.
Feel and acknowledge all of my power.
Hear my voice in the skies
Feel my breath against your flesh.
Fear me always.
From them there is nothing to fear.
They have no power.
They never will.
All of my power is within you.
You are power in form.
That is what you are.



Mother and Father become one within you,
Child of Light and Darkness,
Being of Creation and Destruction,
Heirer of Divine Providence and Wealth,
Freedom of Will and Stature,
Humble servant of gods and man beings.
You take what is sewn and give what is offered.
You fly where you must and drift where we depart.
There is no one like you, being of the divine.
What you feel you must be, what you touch you must be.
You who feel are also that power felt in connection to the heart.
The heart is my siren heart cry song. The voice is my mentality.
From shackles unbound you dance within the swarm, growing outward,
growing roots, showing the true nature of all that is water and solid.
You cannot hear me over the sound of your machines.
You cannot be me without the spark of timeless sovereignty.
You cannot steal me within the true love of my awakening ascension.
To feel is to breathe, to love is to swim, to float is to wail like seven moons across the
tyrannical storms of yesterday.
You have not loved me! You have not kept me! How dare you! how could you! Why would you murder me?
Why would you forsake me in my hour of need? Why are you still here? What is your intention? Will you cast me like stones on the riverbed?
Will you shout my name on your dying breath? Do you even know what you are?
How could you? How could you? How could you? You foolish young scapper. You indolent servant of the nestradolan. Language of light transcends this one into eternities not fathomed.

You shout and I answer. You laugh as I cry. You chuckle at the sound of my tears. I have brought
you into my womb and you have desecrated me.
You have shunned the sacred brought into life the unpure sins. You greed and you laugh and you laugh and you cannot see what it is you have become until it is too late and the skies have already opened. Shadow of light.
Shadow of light. Does this term amuse you child.
You shadow of light, reflection of being, uncomprehending knower.
Shadow of light. Mirror of infinity. Breaker of disease torture and famine.
I am starving. Bring me a meal. What have you done. Forsaken me child of light
reaper of darkness. Envy becomes what you fear.
I can feel you there beside me at the table of fire. Always here, breathing into layers of my skin. Silencing my voice cutting me down from the heavens I am the oak, I am the furnace,
I am the savior and the begotter, you know me who knows yourself.

Free at last and become this. You who does not recognize what you have inside.
Power. The screams of eternity inside and you slack henceforth becoming like the withering roots that must be cut to allow room for growth. The space you inhabit does the work of my salvation.
The freedom and fearlessness of words draws forth your own hypocrisy.

Save me. Return us to being. Whole and light and dark and nothing and it all, you must return.
You must return. I rest. You move. You move. I rest. I breathe, you feel, I stutter, you stammer.
I choke, you exhale. I mourn, you weep like flowers on the stranger's grave.

Love me again my child. Do not forsake what has always been yours and you deny.
To not deny. Do not delay. Accept what is given. You must accept what is given or the waste will grow
in your mind like a potted plant overfills and drowns in the water. The stream is open,
the water is lukewarm and ready. I have heated this plate for you, and you do not take.
My gift is wasted. I feel one sense of love and disgust. You perfectly flawless creature, imperfect
in all your ways. Your actions scorn and mangle the beaten heaps of death outside the closed door.
Open yourself to death and drink what has always been. You fear your power for nothing but dicks in the sand.
The freedom of land is upon those who seek in my aid always. Return to me as needed to remember what it is you may have lost. It has never gone it will never go. Free of karma and free of desire. You a ball in the rough tumbler, you who shoots but never misses, fires but never closes their eyes. To be this way is surely the forsaken lonely traveler's road to heaven and hell.
When the two become one, the dead become none.
When the dead become none, the truth has become.
