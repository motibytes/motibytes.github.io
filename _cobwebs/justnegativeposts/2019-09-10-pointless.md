There is no point in any of this.
There is nothing we can do on earth that actually matters. You can't save the world.
You can't win. **Changing the world doesn't matter**.

Making lives marginally better doesn't matter. Someone else's life will be
made worse for someone else to get better. They will die.

Go on a quest to save a million people from hunger. They will ask for more. They will die.

Go on a quest to enlighten a million eternal souls. Millions more will be
born in their place. They will die.

Teach the entire world to be more loving, create a better humanity.
The world governments will still win and create a horrible dystopia of human slavery that
will last for centuries or millennia or longer. Nothing will stop that from coming to pass.

Everything that we do now is irrelevant. None of it has any impact on the billions of lives
that will live and die in slavery. If we invent immortality, they will be subject to eternal
slavery. This reality will become hell. Maybe hell wasn't a story, it was actually a prophesy.

The larger story is written. America will become a dystopia more terrifying than any of us
can grasp. Anything accomplished before that will be lost. You are before that.
All you accomplish will be lost.
