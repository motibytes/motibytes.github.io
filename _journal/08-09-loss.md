you know, ive read some buddhist poetry about attachment and its made me think

im not sure how much we really do get to control it in the long run. i think maybe we dont want to attach to others because loss and separation can feel extremely painful, so we devise methods to avoid that pain.
but when you really think about the human experience on the level of thought...
it seems there are some things that come with the human condition whether we like it or not.
Perhaps unbearable pains are part of life. i am not so sure we can really escape them. maybe temporarily.
