yeah, look at every evil person who ever lived, all of them were trying to be good in their own way,
hitler was beloved by his people because he made life better for them by making it worse for others.
every country understands that it can only take power if it takes resources from others

one persons good is anothers evil

but on a deeper level we can access meaning that already exists, they call that access 'love'.

and of course rome was destroyed not because of any other reason besides that its war engine became too spread out and yes, it lacked the ability to self govern at scale, but more importantly,
they could not take external resources from others fast enough to supply the citizens with what kept them civil.

natural consequence is, if you make yourself greater to some, you become more monstrous to others

but your inherent meaning in existing itself is not dependent on an external agenda, like love, it is not possessive of any other in order to be.
I am mattering because I exist, I exist because I matter,
why do I matter? because I exist? why do i exist? because I matter. I am mattering.
