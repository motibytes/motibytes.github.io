How you can help your world, our world change for the better during COVID-19.

This message isn't just fluff. This is real. And I am sorry, I am truly truly sorry that there is not much real in the world, that we hear so many scams and avoid so many traps because people are willing to deceive others for their own benefit, and I'm sorry for that, I'm sorry we've become so desensitized that the word "truth" has become a falsity, that when talk of change even comes up we want to close our ears and our eyes because analyzing it just becomes overwhelming. I know that and I'm sorry. There is an actual practical plan here to start changing things now. And it is going to take some work. It's good work, and it will feel good, but it is work. If you have been asking what you could be doing right now to help and saying you wish you could do more, I will give you an answer, and after hearing this, you really can never honestly say you didn't know what to do to help, that you were powerless, that there was nothing you could have done, that just won't be true. In asking you to listen to this message, I am appealing to your caring about your world, or your caring about yourself.

We're at a critical turning point in history right now, in a state of changability we will likely never see again. While we as individuals are realizing that we do each have our own stories and can decide what we want to do with our lives, those with finances and control over this world are also making the final moves to concrete and finalize their power. We are unmistakably, each and every one of us are all a critical part of the future now, and your actions do matter.

I want to appeal to any of you that feel that you don't want to help other people. You do. Because if you don't like the world you are living in, that means that you want to live in a better world. I'm not talking about a fantasy disneyland, I'm talking about the kind of world that you personally would want to live in. And helping others will create a better world for you, both in your life, as well as on a global scale. If you think you can't help, or this doesn't apply to your life, you can, and it does. More than likely, right now because of this pandemic you're actually in the perfect position to help.

So we as a collective people all can agree that now is a good opportunity to slow down. I'd like to talk about a little bit of what that really means.
We all know that we need to slow down. But why do we need to slow down? Because we need to care about ourselves. Because we need to take care of ourselves. Because we can't take care of ourselves and others if we're not taking care of ourselves.
So what does slowing down actually mean? It is creating space from the problems in the moment to reassess and reflect on what it is we're doing. It is taking the space to observe ourselves and our lives in a conscious way. And even with no outside influence, that is a hard thing to do! And yet we're always trying to do it.
It's asking ourselves again what it is we want, and what we're willing to do to get it. What compromises we'll make for our comfort and security, what trade offs we'll make for our dreams in order to live in a realistic world.

So lets look at the whole for a moment. In every person's life right now we can see that there are large changes happening. Either it be relocation or jobs ending or any number of circumstances on the surface, we could say that there is an observable constant right now that we can observe that everyone's life is in a state of change, and what the future looks like is a matter of possibility.

Now, possibility is a scary thing. Possibility brings excitement, which also is experienced as anxiety. There is not much more terrifying than not knowing what your future holds, not knowing what tomorrow will look like. Change is scary. It can even be painful, and pain is scary. So we could say that for a lot of people, right now is a scary time.

But once we get past a little bit of fear, we can look at this and see that the possibility opening up in your life is an amazing thing. It is a chance to change course, to find out what you want, to have more. In another sense, what once seemed impossible, is now possible. Imagine that! It's like the bridge that was once uncrossable can now be walked upon.   #####So will we walk across it?

It's always scary, but then when you think about it, you do want your life to be different. A common problem among us, though, is we know we want a better life, but we
still don't know what exactly we want.

 Finding that out can take a lot of searching, learning, experiencing, and reading. I'm not going to break all that down today. But I will make an argument, that what you want is the elusive thing called happiness. And while I won't tell you how to get inner happiness, I'll make this argument. It's going to be a bit easier to be happy if you're living in a world you want to be in.

So what does that world look like? I would say that is a world where people love you, they support you, they help you when you struggle, they are kind to you, they are working together.
Now why would you actually want this?
