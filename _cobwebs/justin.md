To Whom It May Concern,

Justin (LastName) is a good man with a good heart, continually striving to make positive choices and changes in his life.

I grew up with Justin. He suffered serious trauma, sexual abuse, in
childhood and has struggled with mental health disorders. In a way, the young adult Justin was still mentally the traumatized child that needed to feel safe. In his past his paranoid tendencies led him to make reactions out of fear, without being able to trust the world around him and a lack of inner security. I don't believe Justin carried bad intentions. He made the wrong choices and paid the price for them. Prison and terrifying mental experiences were the hand he was dealt later in life.

I have grown up around good people and very bad people. People who carry evil in their hearts and most often escape justice and the law. Justin is not one of those bad people. They say prison changes you. It turns individuals into hateful monsters, molds them into repeat offenders of our criminal justice system, or breaks them entirely. I believe no matter how unaMost people who return from prison, it's as if they lost something. For Justin, I think he found something instead. 

I think Justin found his real self there.

While it is up to the court's discretion as to whether he has served his time, my opinion is he has, and that it is time for him to continue building and growing his life.
