Running out of time here, only two days before launch.  -->
I've never pursued something for this long before and watched it
grow, watched myself grow with it to this extent. I've never taken a
chance like this before either. It will hurt to fall.

I am willing to fail. I am ready for pain and what life has in
store for me. The voice mocking me and filling my mind with doubt, sometimes it can be right, like for example that this post is utter trash. This isn't my usual writer's voice.
It feels repressed. I think this is the voice of fear.

Tell me I'm delusional. Tell me I'm crazy. I'm not crazy enough yet.
I know things won't turn out exactly how I want them to and that's what
scares me the most. But I'm asking you God, give me a win this once.

Lend me the support of the world. Let me know I'm on the right track.
Show me if there's a key I'm missing. Something keeping me from the next level.
I want more, God. Give me more. Let me do more.
I'm ready for the next level. I got this.
