January 22nd, 2018
was a day of apparent miracles for the media powerhouse known as Netflix. The company received its first Oscar nomination for best picture. On this same day, Netlix crossed $100 billion in market capitalization, becoming the largest digital media and entertainment company in the world. On this same day, Netflix sought and was approved for membership into the Motion Picture Association of America.

The MPAA unilaterally accepted Netflix, endorsed by Disney, Fox, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. Unilaterally. The MPAA spokesman stated,
> "Adding Netflix will allow us to even more effectively advocate for the global community of creative storytellers, and I look forward to seeing what we can all achieve together."

Nothing could be closer to the truth.

The year is 2019. The MPAA has rebranded themselves as the Motion Picture Association.

__They are now the Motion Picture Association of the world.__ Netflix is now available to every country excepting China, Syria, North Korea, Iran, and Crimea. To put this into perspective, there is now one company that delivers media content to anyone with the means to view it.

This company has the power to pick and choose what content it offers to its audience.

This company can create their own movies and TV shows and promote their content above any other.

This company can restrict access to anyone who doesn't play by their rules.

Welcome to a Netflix World, where one set of influencers have the power to push the political, sociological views and opinions that best serve their interests into every culture and society as they see fit, while rejecting any content that does not serve their vision. They will singlehandedly control what we see, what goes on air. We'll watch what they want us to watch, think what they want us to think, be aware of what they want us to know, and believe what they want us to believe. Our perception of the world is based on perspective, and Netflix, backed by the MPA, is now the keyholder to that perspective.

And they're just getting started.
To quote the Kremlin (Russia) on an "American plot to subvert Russian society and culture",
> _"The White House had [realized] how to enter every home, creep into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth, with the help of Netflix."_

If only Russia understood, this isn't _'American'_ plotting anymore. This is the nature of mass information control, manipulation and influence from our fellows who run the world.
