"Michael, one of the holy angels, who was appointed over the good ones of the people
and over the chaos." 

Enoch 25
   "I want to know about all things, and especially about this tree."
 a sweet smelling tree...given to the righteous and the holy chosen ones for food,
 and it will be transplanted to the holy place from the house of God, King of eternity.
 Then the cheerful will be cheered and rejoice. And they will go to the holy place.
 It's fragrance is in its bones,
 and they will live much more life upon earth, such as your fathers lived.
 And in their days, torments, and blows and whips will not touch them.

Enoch:
And the great glory was seated upon it, its covering like the appearance of the sun,
brighter and whiter than all snow. And all of the angels were not able to go into this house
and see his face because of the honored and esteemed one. And all flesh was not able
to see him.
The fire was burning in a circle, and the great fire stood beside it.
No one comes near to him in the circle; numberless ten thousands stood before him,
and all of his reason is a work. The holy ones of the angels who come near to him do
not withdraw with the night, neither do they leave him.

Thoth:
Displaying his role as arbitrator, he had overseen the three epic battles between good
and evil. All three battles are fundamentally the same and belong to different periods.
one god represented order while the other represented chaos.
If one god was seriously injured, Thoth would heal them to prevent either from overtaking
the other.

 He was the scribe to the gods who kept a great library of scrolls,
 over which Seshat (the goddess of writing) was thought to be mistress.
