Life to me is about.. doing what we can do to be okay

Whatever we can do

And when we decide to take care of ourselves, we do what others say we shouldn't do

But we still operate within the bounds of what some people say we should do

But we don't know if living our lives however we want is okay. And we have evidence
to support the contrary. That for example a person who hasn't done inner work shouldn't
 be teaching. That's an example in which living however we want shows our human failure
