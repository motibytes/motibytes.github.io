...thinking about the issues regarding trust and connection

even though we're afraid to do that.. it is an action that when taken is never regretted.

James Bytes Because we have an expectation of who we believe other people are. If they say something truthful that hurts us, we take that as a betrayal of trust. Without trust, we disconnect.
In relationships we play a balance between truth and trust.

Belle Namaste James Bytes yes and it usually comes down to trusting our own decisions that come from the right intentions ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’š

<!--
I want to live in a world where we are not afraid of each other. Where we arenâ€™t afraid of saying the wrong thing to someone else. Where we arenâ€™t afraid to look each other in the eyes for five minutes, where oneâ€™s touch isnâ€™t scary. Where we see each person as ourself.
A world where you donâ€™t second question anotherâ€™s motives or intentions.
We are all so alienated from one another, sharaing only what we think is safe to be shared, only what we think will be seen as okay or that conforms to what we perceive as strong or adult or powerful or right â€¦
