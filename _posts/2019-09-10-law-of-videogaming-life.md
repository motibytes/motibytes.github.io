# LAW OF VIDEOGAMING LIFE
Pretend your life is a video game. (SECRET: it is)

### 1. Try Again
> You can try again if you fail. <br>
> You have nothing to lose.  <br>
> You have absolutely everything to gain.  <br>

<br>

<h3>2. No Penalties </h3>
There are no consequences for losing or winning.<br>
Lose as hard as you can if you like, in order to learn what to do.<br>
You also can choose not to win. You can aim to simply enjoy the game if you like.
<br> <br>
<h3>3. No Refresh </h3>
There is no reason to wish you hadn't done something sooner.<br>
Next time you can do that earlier on.<br>
Wishing you had done something before now does nothing to help you beat the game now.<br>
Now you can do that something until the end of the game.
<br> <br>
<h3>4. Main Quest </h3>
You are here to complete your story.<br>
You are here to fulfill your destiny.<br>
You are free to chase side quests as well.		<br> <br>
<h3>5. NPCs </h3>
Non playable characters are all around you.<br>
Learn how they work.<br>
Learn what they like.<br>
Learn what they want.<br>
Learn what they need.<br>
Destroy them or make them follow you.<br>
Do not allow them to distract you or surrender.
<br> <br>
<h3>6. NPCs can Mislead </h3>
NPCs even with the most innocent of intentions can have programming instructions to distract you from your objectives to increase the challenge of your game.<br>
Keep in mind they may sometimes attempt to stray you from winning the game.
<br> <br>
<h3>7. NPCs Offer Mini Quests</h3>

What NPCs ask of you may or may not be what they need nor the right choice.<br>
You can do what they ask, or not. It is your choice.<br>
Your story is not their side plot.		<br> <br>

<h3>8. Find Your Companions</h3>
There are valuable allies waiting to aid you on your quest. <br>
Find and join forces with them.
<br> <br>
<h3>9. Complete your Directives</h3>
Listen to your core, to your heart.<br>
Your clearly defined Directives,
programming instructions, objectives, purpose that have always been there for as long as you can remember.<br>
Maybe one, maybe multiple, but they are always there.<br>
You have always known that is why you are here.		<br> <br>
<h3>10. Do Not Distract Yourself.</h3>
Sometimes you will be so afraid of following your Directive that you will attempt to find a new purpose that doesn't exist.<br>
You may forget about your original directive or diminish its value to the point that it no longer seems possible or like your purpose.<br>
You will then end up searching for a new purpose only to not find it, or settle for (See Law 2.) entertainment, simply enjoying the game.
<br> <br>
<h3>11. No Impossibility</h3>
Fear is the enemy that tells you your Directives are not accomplishable.<br>
The perceived impossibility to achieve your purpose is a lie.<br>
It is accomplishable, not too late(see Law 3.), now.<br>
You wouldn't still be playing the game if it wasn't still possible to win it.		<br> <br>
<h3>12. Feelings are Immersion </h3>

Feelings are enhancement to this game.<br>
Feelings exist in this world to increase the overall quality of your experience.<br>
Feelings are meant to be enjoyed to increase the realness of the game.
<br> <br>
<h3>13. Feelings are Overwhelming.</h3>

Feelings can sometimes be so immersive that your choices become based off of them.<br>
Managing your feelings is a key part of winning your game.
<br> <br>
<h3>14. Secrets and Hints are Everywhere.</h3>
Little Hints of wisdom from past players are everywhere in this world.<br>
Learning to filter and decipher Secrets can drastically cut time and even allow you to skip longer tutorial segments.
<br> <br>

<h3>15. There are Cheat Codes  </h3>
This game is rigged for your benefit.
Certain values can have a profound impact on your experience.
Increasing your positive thinking, love, kindness and other traits are overpowered abilities that make the game work in your favor.
<br><br>
<h3>16. You are the Player  </h3>
You are not the character.<br>
You are playing as the character.<br>
You are the Player playing the character.		<br> <br>

<h3>17. YOU ARE THE PLAYER  </h3>
YOU ARE THE PLAYER PLAYING THE CHARACTER
