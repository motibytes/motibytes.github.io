It's all about trust right now, always has been really. I have to learn to fully trust others even though I can receive pain and may not be loved or accepted. Because my negative feelings that come with fear of pain, can actually hurt others, even if I am not aware of it. So the choice is simply do I feel pain or do I cause others to feel pain through my actions.

...when that injury opens when i hurt others... what should i do about that,
should i heal it?
