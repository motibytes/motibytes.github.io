Enter the Void

Please hear me, literally anyone, everyone in this rabbit hole. This material is not the temptations and allusions it appears on the surface. I saw its nature last night. This post is writing about the course of a few milliseconds.

If you watch enough of this content, there is a darkness you can feel within some of it. The deeper you go, the more distinctly you can perceive it. As this culture grows it gets burrowed away and hidden. The "B" files are an outlier, obviously not a hidden sense of this. But the presence is obscured as younger sissies have been creating content for a few years now. The older the videos you watch though, you'll find that they share this common presence, and the older the videos, the stronger the presence it is. Eventually if you stick with it enough, it becomes more of a subtle vengeful irritation that gets directed outwards..

Now last night, I had a real stressful day. I've been sober off alcohol quite some time now. (It just so happens I don't ever mention that it seems every time I got blackout drunk I also somehow found myself relapsing on this content). So, last night I went out and bought some whippits, nitrous oxide, gas. I'll cut the filler here.

I'm watching a video where she's telling me my girlfriend was always cheating on me and I've always been gay. Taking in a breath. And I black out, for a moment I begin to pop out of existence. What buddhists call death of the ego, the self. And in a split second, there is eternity.

There is a part of my mind that is able to identify and make a connection that the "experience" or "place" I am going to has the same distinct characteristic of the void I have been to before, and spent far too long there. The infinite abyss. I could describe this trademark characteristic as if something were reaching out claws for you in the form of a silent scream that will grow forever and pull forever as it gets louder and louder.

In this case however, this is a specific abyss, within the same endless void. And in one second I saw of and was aware of all of the sissy material that exists. Not just the hardcore porn. The ideas. The allures. The desires. The insecurities. The submissions. The fantasies. The cravings. That desire to submit to a real man. That desire to become worthless. That enticing excitement of fear that you might do or agree to something you can't take back. The allusion of a sense of safety and security and peace. The degradation and embarrassment. The chase after glamour and glitter. The exalted liberation of your shame. Liberation from the guilt of being a male who has sexual urges and wants to get off. Liberation from the burden of failure, the daily struggle of holding up a false sense of pride in life. But more than anything, that deep, calling desire to completely lose control.


I saw all of the material, and all of those desires and hooks, and I saw that all of them were just the tip of an iceberg. I saw that all of it was like an extremely thin layer of crust, just the thinnest, thinnest paper, just cardboard. With nothing underneath. That none of the promises in this content held any value. All empty promises.  Not attaining a single one would hold a reward underneath. And even worse, deceptive promises. You open your packages and they aren't what you ordered. What you ordered was to feel slutty or pink and sexy or victimized or weak and submissive, or even affirmed in your gender identity, and that's not what's delivered.

And underneath this super thin paper, I could see what generated each of these desires, images, content, in a way that I could only describe as a voice. A voice so distinct and tangible you could touch it, feel its grit and see its color. And that voice generated these paper illusions with the same lie. That underneath all of them was just one lie. Not many different lies, just one simple deceptive lie.
And I guess what that lie would be in simple terms would be like,
"eat this, it tastes good", or just "there's something here."
The lie is that you would **want it**.
Feeling trapped feels good. You might want to feel trapped. But this trap, this sissy trap, its smoke and mirrors. The trap doesn't feel good. At the end there's not going to be any of the pleasure that was promised in it. It's not gone, it was never there. Instead, the feeling of **that** abyss is simply awful, awful dread and the complete absence of a sense of security. A complete lack of meaning, of purpose, of any kind of gratification or pleasure. The chain you're getting tied to, it's not comfortable. It's not fun or kinky. It's more like asking to be tied up and instead a guy puts a gun to your head and shoots your kneecaps.

You might want to be a slave, but you don't want to be a slave to this. You don't want to be pulled by this chain. There is an eternity there. And underneath that super thin layer of a few fantasies, I'm not going to get religious and call it demonic, but it's just purely negativity. Ten thousand negative lies tied to strings that come from negativity into eternity. A negative eternity is not a great reality. and yeah.. somewhere within it there's a pretty scarily powerful, malicious cruel hateful entity, one that I would not say comes from sissyhypno, but that sissyhypno is one of its many hands.


I write this off as if it's no big deal because I've been to the void before for longer than living people sanely should. For real, if it were you seeing this you would be, I kid you not, probably checking yourself into a hospital. If you've ever looked over the edge of a cliff and felt the fear of your own death, that panic and terror is that of being aware of...yeah...  

That's the end of my tale.








Just for a moment I want to mention that I found some point over the last year that my eye contact issues and severe psychosis', anxiety and panic attacks, feelings of internal pain and strife within myself, lack of quality sleep, and even my drinking were all tied to this material. As in, eventually enough times (actually years) after I "relapsed" on it, to even notice there was a connection. Because I would block it out and not think about it.
But was I really tired and late for work because I was drinking, or was it because I had binge watched hypno after I got drunk from 2am-6am that night?

tl;dr:
...as for any complaints about a text post.. this subs a wild fucking west fatherfuckers.
