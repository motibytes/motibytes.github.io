Emotional alchemy is an active experience that involves the changing or perhaps, the transmutation of one's own feelings.
This can lead to an entirely different life experience, in which the phrase, 'never a dull moment' becomes an increasingly exciting reality.
For the experienced alchemist, life shifts to a chain of reliefs and joys, in some cases where there is hardly time to prepare for the next bombshell of bliss or satisfaction.

I often use the term 'Shadow Work' to refer to part of this practice, as the parable of riding off into the darkness of night, only to return as the
prodigal son coming home to his kingdom, having been restored with more light than before is a drama commonly understood in Carl Jung's model of the Shadow.
Whether we use emotional alchemy or not, we all are still subjected to this experience of darkness to light in life, regardless of our desire to participate.

You should not expect to understand everything I describe here, as the feeling based reality and operations within it do not translate well into spoken word.
My effort here is to write a universal abstract on the topic. This reading may seem nonlinear, as it is, emotional alchemy is not linear. There are many
entrances from which to start understanding it.   

What I will describe as emotional alchemy is not a formulaic process, such as physical alchemy, this is an evolving process of active and changing refinement,
easier and more rewarding as the person becomes more equipped and aware of their own experience, such as the ability to catch and recognize
antiquated thought patterns.

There is also no question that this experience will always be relative to the individual, one person's methodology and understanding of this will be
vastly different than another's. One person's tool will likely not be accessible to another. A person with a background of mindfulness will also
likely have a more effective experience than the person who is currently consumed by and overwhelmed with thought.

Emotional alchemy at its core, starts with observing emotions that are present. Most of these recurring emotions are
painful, so a core part of this process is a willingness to embrace some level of pain or uncomfortability.
In my personal experience, the difference between facing into an emotional pain and running from that emotional pain is neglible.
My experience is that facing an emotion is about 10% more painful than living with it. It is in the resolution of feeling, or changing of feeling,
or releasing of feeling that is rewarding to many degrees, so it could be said that the reason to pursue emotional alchemy is because it is a
continually rewarding experience, where many treasures can be found in one's own soul.


This process of facing emotion is subtly different from being consumed by emotion, in the former, one retains an intention and focus to grow, change, and heal,
in the latter, one is desiring to explore the depth of that feeling and drown in it. It takes time to begin to recognize the difference.  
Facing emotion is only possible from a positive and self-supportive headspace, most effective when operating from the role of mentally acting as an 'inner consoler',
one who has an intention to give grace and compassion to oneself and console their own troubled feelings.

When this topic is thought up, thoughts usually arise that, "I don't have an inner world like that" or "I'm not that deep" or "That's too complicated for me".
I find these thoughts to be untrue as explored, as at its core, this process is nothing more than having an intention, and being a being that has emotions,
both of which would describe all people. Like many activities, this process is as easy as attempting to try, again and again. Our greatest resource in this area is time,
with which at every moment regardless of what we are doing, we are experiencing emotion, and have a chance to try to work with it.

For those that have not focused on emotions in many years, it becomes more difficult to identify ones feelings as they become unrecognizable as feelings. This is the case
in which one feels that they "feel nothing", or they "don't feel anything", or they feel "an absence of feeling", or even "the absence of an absence of feeling",
all of which are deep spaces of actual feelings that can be worked with once identified as such.  

The most difficult subject of course is the individual who has become obsessed with feeling great at all times, the one who will feel the most despair when
they crash. This person is just as much feeling great as they are running as far as they can from all negative and painful reminders of feelings, to the point
of avoidance of themselves and others in their lives in order to escape the darkness of night.

The way emotions are approached varies circumstancially. There are so many methods of this alchemy, that it is likely you already actively use at least one in your daily
life, and will naturally pick up more as you get older. It could be said then that what I am referring to are methods of advanced emotional alchemy.
The introduction to these methods is simply that you do not know which ones will work for you at this time in your life unless you try them, just as in physical alchemy,
this is a process of experimentation and exploration.

I currently see two stages of alchemy, and they are different enough to not even be the same topics.
The first I have already been describing, facing into emotions that have already surfaced.  

I will outline here in no particular order
some of the methods I have identified and use for the first stage.

1. Asking questions.
Asking yourself questions about what you are feeling, how you are feeling, why you are feeling, is a way to dig into the roots of emotion. In this process you are removing your existing
conclusions and reasons for why you feel this way. You are abandoning what you already have concluded, which is often what you have believed for many years.
A second line of questioning is often the next step, asking, "What am I missing?", "What am I not seeing here?", "What is a different way to interpret what I am experiencing?"

2. Identifying emotional desires and needs.  
It is usually the case that a persistent negative emotion is
