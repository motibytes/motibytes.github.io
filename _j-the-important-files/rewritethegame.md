You said it hurts to be part of the world...we can be of it but not a player in the game...we observe life...thats living in a broader perspective a higher perspective and enables us to diassociate from the emotions but truly feel and understand them...

Rewrite the game

This same notion is where I'm forced to have compassion on those around me right at this moment, they're watching a documentary on Genesis and science and debating about how the biblical god...just...yeah... trapped in ego...



i was just having this conversation about observing a narcissist, observing how like you said there's pity there, they almost have it.
That true ones are so lost in ego that they cannot see outside of it. They can't hear the external world. They cannot listen. It becomes a matter of ability that they don't possess. They can't focus on others because they can't hear.
And if they could take care of themselves they'd be fine, because they could help themselves by helping others.. but these are people who can't help themselvs
the narcissist and the empath exist as the same  being from different points   of view and ages of experience, The narc teaches the young empath how to love themselves by setting reflective boundaries and the empath teaches the narc that there are others in life that require love and care. All is love and all serves love.



that's beautiful

First step to to see self...next is to understand...the bible is a good path for many to understand self better...many do find self that way...so observe it...what emotions it triggers in you then ask why

I was always an observer, always had a broader perspective.. in a world that didn't. talking to you folk is actually quite strange in that I'm not used to hearing people talk about life from the observer standpoint.
Right now I want to play the game as a player for the sake of playing the game. but ill always be observer at the same time.

Im similar tell me your religious and i feel sorry for you a little...a belief right there for me lol

the thing is i want to play the game at a much much higher level than im currently playing it lol



I agree the human aspect is vital...we have to be part of life...interact...we do that whilst remembering like andy says...all is what we choose to see...if we are seeing it...it was a choice

wiothout the minds product of ego, there woul dbe no new creation "after" (the) ONE. No becomings or endings, no loves gained and lost, no dreams  of attaining or ascending. I like being in the middle of it all, where I know myself as everything and also as no ( one) thing  ❤

yep. There is the rare occasion I'll get sucked into being a person temporarily and forget that im playing this game, but usually its all balance, its all about the spiritual and the human and the observing and the all of it.

The best part is when you do realise how responsive life is

the mind allows ONE to become two, a lie made real. It offers us possibilities of becoming only limited by our imagination. The heart  links us to what we are, when the heart and mind are working together in a state of balance, we have the best   of all possible realms 1 and 2, being and becoming as ONE

I have a new little stepsister now (three actually lol), and I see something I recognize in her, this sensitivity that I recognized is what I treasured about myself, this innate beauty, and creativity, and idk recently it just made me see that I don't feel that there's a sense of loss with me not existing.

She was the conduit...i was riding her high...



I get what you mean...life appears flippant when you realise it is eternal...but...in moments....like you seeing her true essence...we see the value in life...we see the plan

The connections

Life is moments

I swear I can almost see the moment that you are describing, as if many mini moments in my life all resonate to that one moment you are speaking of. when I felt loving father energy come out of me for my daughter was one.
According to what I've read, you were riding her high.
I call what you describe, the warmth, the music, the love, the wonder, it is Love. That is the perfect unending source that is the never ending stream of life, it is the golden river, it is the perfect warmth, it is embrace, it is connection, it is eternal, heaven, a force so strong that its more like an ocean than how we describe it
❤

I read plan as pain XD



An ocean would describe it perfectly...deep and unending



No no...plan is restructing beliefs...the resistance is the pain 😉



Those are not my words...i heard them
