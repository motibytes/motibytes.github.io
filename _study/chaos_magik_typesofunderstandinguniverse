"PRIMORDIAL"

Refuting absolutely the notion that this flow of energy is
ever understandable by dualistic minds, Spare stated unequivocally that
the magickal energy of the universe, the force that interpenetrates all
phenomena is non-human.  Moreover Spare required the magician, in order
to avail himself of this force, to renounce his human belief systems, his
dualistic mind, to achieve a state of consciousness that, as much as
possible, mimicked the primordial.

Few magicians can resist
the lure of dark magick, despite protestations of innocence.  This is
because even Wiccan influenced magicians are not, as Wiccans are,
devotees of a religion.  That is to say magicians are interested in the
dynamic of personal will versus (in Crowley's term) True Will, while
Wiccans have resolved this issue.  While the occasional conflict may
remain, Wiccans, like Christians, Jews, and Moslems understand that they
have agreed to submit their wills to that which they construe to be the
Will of their deities.  Magicians, on the other hand, are not so sure.  This,
more than any other factor, accounts for the intense suspicion those of a
religious cast view those who practise magick.
