ENERGY

having emotional states of the past consumes all our energy

but to create the future..


Where am I already doing this? Where have I not been applying this?
Where have I gone halfway and not had the follow through?
...
the decision maker...

in daily life it should be new new new new new. not chasing old emotional states
with my music.

this is magic..



imagining the future I want and then placing the emotion I would have there into
that memory and bringing it forth.


...and i do believe in flow.
and that time isn't real.
