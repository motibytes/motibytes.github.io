What if I gave you that message? To tell you what you really wanted, what you really wanted to do? Would you hear it?

Wouldn't people love it if i spoke from many characters?
Free Write 5:20PM:

Why can't I remember? I apparently didn't write any of it down.
Did any of it get expressed in words?
Did I forget... What did I forget? God, Love, please help me remember what I've forgotten... Love, Love I call on you. How can we act differently right now
to change our world?
***********
You can probably guess that I'm going to say to help others means to show them kindness and give. And you probably would think that that is a nice thought, but it doesn't mean much and you
***************
We can show kindness to others. What does that mean?
We can give.
How can we give? We can help each other. But how do people help each other when their life doesn't support that? When they aren't in a position to help others?

People can move into a position that allows them to help others.

 But why would they want to help others? Because we want to live in a better world. We don't want this one. But that isn't enough motivation. We need more. We need more incentive. Inner change will create outer change. We need it to be practical and realistic.
Lets admit that most perspective on a better world where everyone's laughing and singing songs is a bit unrealistic, its not practical in the real world. Such dreams are a bit fantastical, a fantasy, and to some a Disney world of melody and sing-a-long musicals would be its own kind of nightmare.


So we as a collective people all can agree that now is a good opportunity to slow down. I'd like to talk about a little bit of what that really means.
We all know that we need to slow down. But why do we need to slow down? Because we need to care about ourselves. Because we need to take care of ourselves. Because we can't take care of ourselves and others if we're not taking care of ourselves.
So what does slowing down actually mean? It is creating space from the problems in the moment to reassess and reflect on what it is we're doing. It is taking the space to observe ourselves and our lives in a conscious way. And even with no outside influence, that is a hard thing to do! And yet we're always trying to do it.
It's asking ourselves again what it is we want, and what we're willing to do to get it. What compromises we'll make for our comfort and security, what trade offs we'll make for our dreams in order to live in a realistic world.

So lets look at the whole for a moment. In every person's life right now we can see that there are large changes happening. Either it be relocation or jobs ending or any number of circumstances on the surface, we could say that there is an observable constant right now that we can observe that everyone's life is in a state of change, and what the future looks like is a matter of possibility.

Now, possibility is a scary thing. Possibility brings excitement, which also is experienced as anxiety. There is not much more terrifying than not knowing what your future holds, not knowing what tomorrow will look like. Change is scary. It can even be painful, and pain is scary. So we could say that for a lot of people, right now is a scary time.

But once we get past a little bit of fear, we can look at this and see that the possibility opening up in your life is an amazing thing. It is a chance to change course, to find out what you want, to have more. In another sense, what once seemed impossible, is now possible. Imagine that! It's like the bridge that was once uncrossable can now be walked upon. So will we walk across it?

*****
Figuring out what you want in your life. I can just tell you what you really want, you really want happiness, and it's probably been so long since you've had it, that happiness isn't even real to you.
A world where people love you, they support you, they help you when you struggle, they are kind to you, they want you, how did that become a fantasy, instead of a real attainable reality?
********

We don't know what we want though. Finding that out can take a lot of searching, learning, experiencing, and reading. I'm not going to break all that down today. But I will make an argument, that what you want is the elusive thing called happiness. And while I won't tell you how to get inner happiness, I'll make this argument. It's going to be a bit easier to be happy if you're living in a world you want to be in.

So what does that world look like? I would say that is a world where people love you, they support you, they help you when you struggle, they are kind to you, they are working together.
Now why would you actually want this?
----!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And how would this actually work?
---
It's possible to build this life right now.
.....
They can recognize each other as human.
**** They can recognize those in need. (And this is what the later letter is about)
 If they recognize someone else as a human, ask them how they are doing, tell them that they can be of service, make them feel cared about, make them feel valued, make them feel appreciated, see that positive action and reciprocate it to others

Communication
9:10PM 20 minute free write go.

Let's talk about communication. Let's talk about communication. What are we talking about when I say communication? What is the benefit of communicating?
How can we be communicating more? God how can we be communicating more? Brain remind me what it was that we could be communicating more.
If I was working a bad job, what would communication do?
I mean, maybe if I checked in with my coworkers, and asked them how they were doing, I might find some light into their world.
Maybe there is a way that I could support them that they can't do. But can I give an example? Am I just blowing smoke? Help me God. Lord God shine divine light into this text to give me a message that the world is ready to receive, that will reach millions through my voice. Fulfill the prophesy from the prophets about my life.
God!!!!!
Talk to me!  Higher Self!  Break through my mind now!  
Tell me what I need to hear! Yes! Break through! I can feel you waking up. Wake up! Wake up! Yes, you! God! Inner God! Wake Up! I call on your support! Talk to me! What is the message I can help them with!
What can they do today to help them!
What is the message!
What is the message! Channel it through! I am willing. I am surrendering. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. Listen.
Liste. You want them to communicate more.
You want to connect. You want me to tell you how to connect more.
The bridge. Break through the bridge. The kindness breaks through. You can be kind today. That kindness creates change. It starts with you. It starts with your loving voice.

**** tie into the slowing down piece.
It starts by asking the right questions.(this is what we're slowing down to ask)
How can I help? Why do I want to help? What matters to me? What can I do today? Where can I contribute? How are you doing? How are you feeling? What is
the intention?
******
Tell me more. Give me the message Lord. I'm here waiting on you. I waited on you and you answered me with a divine message now. I waited on you and you answered me with a divine message now. I waited on you and you channeled a divine message to me now.
That's how you help them. That's how we help each other.
Please God in Practical Words! In practical words! Tell me what they can do, what all of them can do!!!

They can recognize each other as human.
**** They can recognize those in need. (And this is what the later letter is about)
 If they recognize someone else as a human, ask them how they are doing, tell them that they can be of service, make them feel cared about, make them feel valued, make them feel appreciated, see that positive action and reciprocate it to others
****

Channel this god! Break through! How can they actually help? How can they actually make the change that will cause an impact? What can they actually give today?
Messages are void without action.
What is the action? What is the value that can be given? Is there none?
There is none. Let the world unfold as it should be.
God! Please! What can they give? A letter? A heartfelt letter? A heartfelt letter to every person.
But what good will that do.
To every person you know. To every person you know. That's the key. That can cause the ripple.
Look.
To every person you know.

**** (And God, you will give me the words to give them this motivation, thank you!)
But they don't have the courage, the strength, the desire, to motivation.
****

But you can spend some time thinking about who you care about. Really dig into it.

****(This is where we get into the main message right here)
What if you care about no one?
Then now is the moment you could choose to begin caring about yourself. You might think you already do, but if ********
you're unhappy, lonely and unfulfilled, you're not taking care of yourself. You're suffering. You've been suffering. And the only way to make a change about that is to reach out. Reach out to everyone. Because you have nothing to lose. The only thing kindness will repay back is kindness.

Imagine a world where people are kind to you. They are loving to you. They care about you. They want you. They accept you. Don't you want that? Don't you need that? What if it wasn't that hard to live in that world? What if you just had to reach out a hand?
****
What if you don't know anyone?
There's 7 billion people out there. Send a letter to a hospital. Send a letter anywhere. Everywhere. To strangers. To people you don't know...Most large companies employees have publicly listed email addresses on their web pages. You can email them all. You can send a message and someone just might listen.
****
Imagine this world. A world you didn't hate. A world that wasn't hell. A world where other people embraced you. Wouldn't you want that world?
****
Because see, if you did this, if you are at home not sure what to do(expand on this), and you just started writing letters saying kind words to people, many people, every day, those people are going to respond to you. And you can just keep going from there.

**** (and this is where it hits the large scale)
If this became a chain reaction... it might melt the hardest of hearts. It's all about scaling the ladder. You, listening to this, are probably not the person with abundant access to wealth and finances to help people. You might be. But if enough people started being kind, if people started feeling safe enough to open their cold hearts, to recognize the suffering in others, the heart of one rich person that looked at their life, the unhappiness in it, and recognized the poor as suffering, and recognized they could be kind and share everything they have, they might just transform their life. Imagine the impact of just one person of high status, changing their lifestyle to keeping only what they needed, and spreading their wealth. Just one person's transformation could impact the lives of thousands or tens of thousands in a real, drastic way. The people they know would see the impact of that. They would change.

Yes. Lord. MORE! Thank you Father. Thank you God. God. Lord. Give me a hook. God give me a hook to this message that makes people act. Give me a tool that shakes them to the core. Give me something that cracks their heart open, wide open, now. Now. now. Now. Now. That changes their ways forever. That they can never forget. That they will always remember. An intro line that grabs them. That starts at the beginning. Shine through God. Love Shine Through! Channel this! Let me speak of this on the Tonight Show! Let me be interviewed on every television screen! To tell them how I came up with this! That I prayed out to you! That I called on you! That you put these words through me! Tell me Father! Lord! Mother! Divinity! Love! Higher Self! Me! You! Us!

The message they have to hear. What is it. That the love that they have been always seeking is what they fear the most. The love you want is the pain of innocence lost. The love you want is the freedom you don't have.
Help me god.
The love you have been seeking your entire life is your biggest fear.
What does that mean to you?
How are you going to be the person you dreamed of being?
What does that mean to you?
What is the moment that fits in your heart as the only thing you ever truly cared about and never received.  
You're alone, you've always felt it. But that isn't true, is it?
You're living in a dream. But you're not? Right? You're awake?
Right now? What would you do to wake up? Do you want to be asleep? Do you want to ride in this storm forever?

Give me a sign god. Let this message crack open every heart that reads it and let them share it to every person they know. And I will make the follow up to this podcast. Now. Amen. Grant me this sign god. I have met you halfway. I will share this message if you can meet me halfway. Thank you for this god.
