Just another idea floating by,

If major websites allowed users to set a secondary, 'fake password'
for their accounts, they could leave it where someone would think to look
for your password.

You might leave this fake password on a note on your desk, in a folder
on your computer, maybe in your safe at home.

In the event that someone attempted to use the fake password, an account lockout would be triggered, preventing anyone from gaining
access. The user and website would know that someone had
tried to gain access to the account.
>_"Did you try to log in to your account today?"_

would become,

>_"Someone used your fake password to try to
gain access to your email account. We blocked them."_

This would take away
the websites inability to verify

> _"Was this really you?"_.

An advanced method  would utilize several passwords.
* 1stPa$$W0rd - on my desk
* 2ndPa$$W0rd - in my car  
* 3rdPa$$W0rd - on my phone
* 4thPa$$W0rd - In my iCloud

Upon use of a fake password, the user would
know the compromised location.

A last potential use of this system would go as follows:

Assume you have four bank accounts holding a portion of your life savings. <br>
You distribute the password to each account amongst four people that you want to trust. <br>
To spice up the scenario,
you know that _one_ of them is untrustworthy, but you cannot tell which. Using a classic process of elimination would set you up for potential failure. Give each person a fake password however, lay the trap, and the culprit comes to you.
