That's how you know

Oh my soul

Bleeding heart

Love's wrath

Awaken from your slumber, oh Lord my God.

Hide me in the secret place, dispatch of the enemy that has come to my camp in the night

That when I awake in the morning, I rise up to be the light of the world, not of them, but for them, not for me, but for you, sacred divine, my beloved, my warrior, my comforter, the fire that burns in my lamp, the furnace that devours my darkness, come into me, become me, love, all that I am is yours, this eternity is yours, the gift you have given me to give to you.

Oh rejoice, oh my soul.
