Ocean commotion is where I return, breath breathing in these sparkling rains
afraid of nothing, becoming what i am, i am becoming, and unbecoming, You are Here
and I am There.

tired why so  tired i am writing why isnt the flow coming to where is the direction
to go right now
love life death epace kindness compassion joy renewal strength a being a doing
a calling a shortness a longing a 10,000 words 10,000 words 10,000 years 10,000
hours to mastery more work less work no work all work work work
fun play every day
