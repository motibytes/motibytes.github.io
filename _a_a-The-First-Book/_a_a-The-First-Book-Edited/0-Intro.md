## Intro

The secrets of life arise in our personal stories, as billions attempt to pass thoughts through every medium imaginable.
Rather than having direct access to a fountain of pure wisdom, we are overloaded with masses of information that are useless to us in any practical manner.
It is a tedious search to find what is relevant to our unique lives in an external world holding an expanding infinity of data.

There is no shortage of advice on what to do and how one must live, but a significant lack of information is on how to do **that**, which I think of as how to apply specialized knowledge. How do we filter the truths that apply to us now? How do we know who we should listen to, which concepts we should be absorbing, what is most important for us to understand
so that we might spend more of our time living a meaningful and fulfilling life? These kinds of questions guide and direct my focus.

I believe that personal agendas, beliefs, pride, a need to be right, a lack of honesty, limiting mental models, and deliberate withholdings of information are the prime reasons for a noticeable absence of texts that are concise, useful, practical, applicable in daily life. In all my works I aim to change the standard of how knowledge is being shared by operating by a principle in which I offer you all that I have to give, as concisely and concretely as I can deliver it. It is my intention to give you a gift basket that you can work with,
rather than contribute to a information overload.

My specialty is cultivating and crafting bundles of insights and teachings as easy to read resources that are universally accessible, that is, indiscriminate to faith and ideology.
As this is my first book, I am sharing perspectives and insights that I enjoy sharing.

Thank you for reading with me!
