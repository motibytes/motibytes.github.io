We are all lovers if we feel safe enough to love.

If the conditions are present in which we feel it is safe and acceptable to love, then we experience the love that is already within us.
In other words my theory is we love everything we just don't feel safe enough to experience it because we're all crippled by existential fear of rejection and ego defense mechanisms and shit
