Thoth Chapter 2:

#Now again I tread the path downward,
#seeking the light in the darkness of night.
Hold ye and keep ye, preserve my record,
guide shall it be to the children of men.

Then spoke I:
#O, great master,
#let me be a teacher of men,
#leading then onward and upward until they,
#too, are lights among men;
#freed from the veil of the night that surrounds them,
#flaming with light that shall shine among men.
Spoke to me then the voice:
#Go, as yet will. So be it decreed.
#Master are ye of your destiny,
#free to take or reject at will.
#Take ye the power, take ye the wisdom.
#Shine as a light among the children of men.

Then spoke my guide, the voice of the master:
#See your own soul as it grows in the light,
#free now forever from the Lord of the night.

I, Death, come, and yet I remain not,
for life eternal exists in the ALL;
only an obstacle, I in the pathway,
quick to be conquered by the infinite light.
#Awaken, O flame that burns ever inward,
#flame forth and conquer the veil of the night."
Then in the midst of the flames
in the darkness grew there one that
drove forth the night, flaming, expanding,
ever brighter, until at last was nothing but Light.

Then spoke a voice, mighty and solemn, saying:
#"These are lights that are souls among men,
#growing and fading, existing forever,
#changing yet living, through death into life.
#When they have bloomed into flower,
#reached the zenith of growth in their life,
#swiftly then send I my veil of darkness,
#shrouding and changing to new forms of life.
#Steadily upward throughout the ages, growing,
#expanding into yet another flame,
#lighting the darkness with yet greater power,
#quenched yet unquenched by the veil of the night.
#So grows the soul of man ever upward,
#quenched yet unquenched by the darkness of night.

#Each surrounded by its dim veil of darkness,
#yet flaming with light that could never be quenched.
Coming and going like fireflies in springtime,
filled they with space with Light and with Life.

Oh, master of darkness,
guide of the way from Life unto Life,
before thee I bring a Sun of the morning.
Touch him not ever with the power of night.
Call not his flame to the darkness of night.
Know him, and see him,
one of our brothers,
lifted from darkness into the Light.
#Release thou his flame from its bondage,
#free let it flame through the darkness of night."

Darker than darkness sat the great figure,
dark with a darkness not of the night.

one in one purpose, working together,
bring of Light to the children of men."

Approach ye ever the infinite Wisdom,
ever before thee recedes the goal.

One step thou has gained on the long pathway upward,
infinite now is the mountain of Light.
Each step thou taketh but heightens the mountain;
all of thy progress but lengthens the goal.

Choose thou thy work, for all should must labor,
never be free from the pathway of Light.

Mighty and strange, they,
veiled with their power,
silent, all-knowing,
drawing the Life force,
different yet one with the
children of men.
Aye, different, and yet One
with the Children of Light.

# He who by progress has grown from the darkness,
# lifted himself from the night into light,
free is he made of the Halls of Amenti,
free of the Flower of Light and of Life.
Guided he then, by wisdom and knowledge,
passes from men, to the Master of Life.

There in the circle from aeon to aeon,
sit the Great Masters,
living a life not known among men.
There in the Halls of Life they lie sleeping;
free flows their Soul through the bodies of men.
Time after time, while their bodies lie sleeping,
incarnate they in the bodies of men.
Teaching and guiding onward and upward,
out of the darkness into the light.

Deep in the Halls of Life grew a flower, flaming,
expanding, driving backward the night.

"We are they who were formed from the space-dust,
partaking of life from the infinite ALL;
living in the world as children of men,
#like and yet unlike the children of men."

Builded they then the Halls of Amenti,
that they might dwell eternally there,
living with life to eternity's end.

seeking to free from the bondage of darkness
those who were bound by the force from beyond.

Thoth chapter 1 :
Then having drunk deep of the cup of wisdom,
I looked into the hearts of men and there found I
greater mysteries and was glad.
For only in the Search for Truth could my Soul
be stilled and the flame within be quenched.

Other chambers I built and left vacant to all seeming,
yet hidden within them are the keys to Amenti.
He who in courage would dare the dark realms,
let him be purified first by long fasting.
Lie in the sarcophagus of stone in my chamber.
Then reveal I to him the great mysteries.
Soon shall he follow to where I shall meet him

Preserve ye and keep ye the command of the Dweller:
Lift ever upwards your eyes toward the light.

Know my commandments,
keep them and be them,
and I will be with you,
helping and guiding you into the Light.
Now before me opens the portal.
Go I down in the darkness of night.
