__Do you ever get anxiety about things? im struggling with some major anxiety today. What do you do when/if you get anxiety? just curious.__


Yes. There's been periods where it was completely overwhelming, all consuming, all the time. Now it just rises up maybe a few times a day.
I would say there's a lot of things I do to handle anxiety, but that really there's a gradual process of recognizing and dealing with it that makes it gradually better over a longer period of time. Where you start to see the source of the anxiety and start cutting it off at the source. That along with moving towards a life mindset with less stress and better coping mechanisms for dealing with stress means less anxiety over time.

Breathing into it is my go to in the moment, sometimes pushing it down from my chest into my stomach..
Also pay attention that lack of sleep (or even oversleep) will contribute to worry/anxiety/stress

But what really started to help is realizing where it's coming from. Anxiety/excitement, these overwhelming butterflies in the chest are the same emotion, that we can recognize have a relationship with action. The longer I wait to do something the harder it gets to do it. The more I think about doing something the more anxiety I get.
The longer we wait to take an action, the more resistance seems to build, it's like I can feel hesitation on the outside of my body begin to constrict me and begin to strangle me,  and now sitting there strangled, I start to entertain thoughts of self-doubt, worry, fears in my head.
My body, my ego defense mechanisms are really sending a message saying, "You can't do that, you could get hurt, I'm trying to protect us, I know how to protect us, so I'm going to send you these warning messages to stop you from hurting us."
But we know that that defense mechanism isn't helping us as it's trying to, it's actually sabotaging our life. So we know we have to recognize that these thoughts aren't coming from us, they're coming from this defense mechanism that's actually getting in our way, and getting in the way of what we want to do. Focusing on the breath we can calm the body down enough to recognize that this is the case.

That seems to be the emergency solution, not the long term one.
Reducing stress, and actively doing things we have anxiety towards,
expanding our imagined limits and our horizons and seeing that it's almost never as bad as we thought when we do something, it gets easier and easier.

But as for the actual practice that helped me get rid of anxiety being a problem, rather than just dealing with it all the time,
Is recognizing that when I feel anxiety, there is a hidden feeling inside me. There's something I'm afraid of. That I'm afraid of feeling.
That's right there. They say the feeling is just "That Feeling." And that when you face it, focus on it, breathe into it, sit with it, accept it, what have you, your fear and anxiety run away. Because really you were running from that feeling.

I think to put a name on it, the feeling we run from is very close to being called "stillness", "uncomfortability"
But simply looking into that helps. And for me has over time lessened the amount of anxiety I experience by a lot.
