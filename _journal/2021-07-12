can't even remember what i wanted to get out.

was it that i realized that the reason that im afraid of others getting near me and seeing me is that I might not convince them of my facade,
that they might see me, and me knowing they saw me, I would be forced to see myself

was it that i have no consistent voice

..
what im finding crazy interesting is ive been channeling the creative and also the dark side of my consciousness for extended periods of time,
And I do not mean I've just been "being creative." I mean something I haven't experienced in a lifetime of 27 years..
And  I swear to you...
It feels like opening the door to this creative side,
It reminds me of the experiments, where they have the left and right sides of the brain communicate
