To truly carry a love for them with an open heart..
Spirituality is just our way of being able to understand something so divine as this ..


    And if you express your heart, those that live in fear are going to reject you out of fear and you just have to accept that, because the benefits of growing your heart and those you will connect with are worth it.

    Message:       give yourself this          <--

    The difference between an internal seeking of love and an outward
     giving of love and the fulfillment of it...
    But also... The satisfaction of feeling seen, of the previous
     whimsical light sensitive happy loving childish immature feather
     of a perfect being being recognized and and seen, given the right
      and permission to exist and be loved, and it only happens after
       I've recognized this in myself first, that I'm worth it and
       deserve to be loved.

    Congratulations! What if even though I've only witnessed
    that for a few minutes or hours with smiles and hellos,
    what if....what if congratulations were all the time
