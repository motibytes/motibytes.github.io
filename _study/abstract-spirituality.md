It's possible that my shadow will always be proportional to my light, and as one grows, so too will the other... What amount of myself and my shadow can I conquer... What amount of power could I possess... But more importantly... How does that translate into my external life?
Praying to God to bring to me my destiny is the only answer I really have, because without him, none of that could matter, because I won't have the ability to do anything, not only because he gives me breath, but also because I can't control the world.

There should be no limit to God... And thereshould be no limit to me...

Crazy man basically says that English is a trap
That the bible and books are the black books
That an ancient spirit tries to trick us to get us to evoke it and give it power... But so much deeper than that...
He calls himself a (water something) creator? Says he has (renounced) the book
That bad people used names making the book forbidden
Looked in his eyes when he talked about knowing god and it looked like He Really Knew God.

So I gather that basically... He believes we are being tricked to think we're not god and lose our power to an entity that is actually lifeless and dead, that could not even be alive anymore, and that English is the tool used to accomplish such a massive lie.

And it fucking lines up... With... What I've heard... And I'm pretty sure he didn't read any of this shit he probably self actualized in a schizo trip

Our past projects into the future

Shifting inner witness to the heart , we achieve an ability to master our focus and concentration while we are actively engaged in something else.
What we are doing is stabilizing our consciousness in essential identity, which doesn't depend on a specific action to nourish it.

Adam and Eve is the moment we first thought of ourselves as separate beings.

--sopjia - it is tremendous how we make our mother Kundalini suffer

Romantic love we've reached that place of foreverness, feeling of novelty and familiarity at the same time. This feeling is to be trusted.


Can imagine sucking in the world's depression into a black cloud and then breathing out a golden cloud of whatever I have to offer

Might say to illness, thank you for causing me harm and I invite you to return, please take whatever you want, ravage me. I thank you for waking me up from my state of sleepiness and stupor.

To free our souls, we may have to be loosened by our suffering and our problems. Rather than look for ways to be further in control, we may have to surrender to the vitality that is trying to get some representation. (rather than understand our dreams, we might be understood by them-reimagine our lives through their challenging images).
Rather than get life together, we might allow life to have its way with us and get us together in a form that is a surprise.
True personal strength is not to be found in an iron will or in superior intelligence. Real strength of character shows itself in a willingness to let life sweep over us and burrow its way into us. Courage appears as we open ourselves to the natural alchemy of personal transformation, not when we close ourselves by making the changes we think are best.

Religion is the only ground on which our humanity can stand and thrive... Religion as an open heart of allowing life to unfold and strong enough to support a radical philosophy of love.

The human soul is half human, if we ignore that half, we are only half human, and half human is almost as bad as not human at all
----
Stress is from drivenness, to understand as much as possible, is killing us.
----
We are so accustomed to imagining spirituality without body, sex, and imagination that when we see them linked, we judge them spurious and treat them as a threat. We live in an antipagan world of abstraction, where God has fallen out of love with his creation.

We call things superstition and consider that naive, but our sophistication, rooted in a deep rift between spirit and matter, is itself suspicious. How strange to assume there is nothing but what can be perceived by the senses and measured in the language of quantification.

We talk about how religious practice should influence our daily lives, but it does so at a distance because the two are imagined as fundamentally different.
-----

Two ways of being, kineticnand static.

(society has forgotten the soul but) We can live differently, basking in the exoticism and eccentricity of a life of vision.

To wake up to vitality Find holes in the illusory literalism of everyday life.

Once we penetrate the illusory veil of literalism and glimpse the layers in events, we may never go back to the Fabrications of fact. We will have become poets of the every day.

A writer sees a flash in his sense of reality and with his art keeps that vision at hand.

Imagination is real, fact is the illusion. .

--------
Power, greed, ambition, desire, love, will, in each of these a powerful daimon resides.
A daimon is not a problem, it is the source of our creativity and identity. In the daimonic it is not easy to distinguish the good from the bad.
If in our fear and confusion we fail to engage it...negative qualities appear to dominate...
But take it on courageously, we can discover how creative and constructive it can be.
--- In a second it can spark into life a job or a romance that we have been laboring for months or years to achieve. ----

When we have no ongoing relationship to the daimon, it metamorphoses into a demon.
Because of our limited conscious view, we may wrongly confuse daimonic generally with demonic.

On the other hand, the daimonic force could be transformed into a passion for peace and drive toward happiness, it doesn't have to be militant and negative.
It demands that we adjust to it, that we constantly reimagine ourselves and our lives in relation to it's creative work.

We might notice how our passions seem to move in a direction opposite the image we have of ourselves. This is as it should be because the self that we construct carefully in family and society may be too full of ego, conscious will, and intention to make a real life. A human being cannot manufacture a living, creative self, because only the soul is sufficiently deep and powerful and has adequate resources to give life to a personality.

 And the daimon is to the soul what the ego is to the self.
---------
Without the insights of pagan spirituality, we divide our lives into the sacred and the profane, one is the church and the second the rest of existence.

---
Paganism is not a belief system, it is a way of life in which one appreciates the holiness of every facet of experience and honors that holiness with specific rites and images.
Pagans saw sacredness and depth everywhere.

It's much easier than the below. It's just living and loving.
_________

Perspective when you forget.
You were alone at the garden of Solace, you chose you wanted to exist, to be part of this experience. That by participating and not hiding, by remembering that you have an intrinsic value that cannot be taken from you, it made you full of light and happy. And you love light. And you know that loving others and loving yourself makes you happy. That reconciling your demons and learning makes you more whole. To be of single mind is to not be sick anymore. To love the words of Jesus, to soak in the holy spirit, to surrender to God, to remember that you are loved and okay, to fill yourself with new wine into the new skin, to choose to try, it is a life worth living. Because you have self worth, value, and because of that you are safe, you know that to love there is no fear, you know that to expand your heart is right, you know that to consider others, to love the world, is gods heart, the way to God. To face pain. To grow your heart. That's what you want.

Perhaps what he meant of how that was a word curse was that it was speaking that something *would come* that was already available.

‚ÄúThou shalt not make to thyself any
graven image, nor the likeness of anything that is in
heaven above; . . . thou shalt not bow down to
them, nor worship them.‚Äù

To discover the ultimate Reality of life‚Äîthe Ah
solute, the eternal, God‚Äîyou must cease to try to
grasp it in the forms of idols. These idols are not just
crude images, such as the mental picture of God as
an old gentleman on a golden throne. They are our
beliefs, our cherished preconceptions of the truth,
which block the unreserved opening of mind and
heart to reality. The legitimate use of images is to
express the truth, not to possess it.

By contrast, hell or ‚Äúeverlasting damnation‚Äù is not
the everlastingness of time going on forever, but of
the unbroken circle, the continuity and frustration
of going round and round in pursuit of something
which can never be attained. Hell is the fatuity, the
everlasting impossibility, of self-love, self-conscious¬¨
ness, and self-possession. It is trying to see ones own
eyes, hear one s own ears, and kiss one's own lips.

The whole world is just energy bouncing. What exists if it's not reflecting? That's the clue: reflection. The reflective life, the contemplatory life, is therefore wisdom.

Watts: he has to have a few of these little vices and things to keep him grounded, to keep him in the world!

Me: Note that gnosticism/ sophia is a "feel good"
story. It puts us in power and we only worship to gain more power, in an idolation sort of way. It sounds like it was made up by people...but most importantly... It loses the most important element of spirituality, true surrender (not just bowing), and...ultimately feels juvenile, like some teenagers angry at god.
But the holy mother is real in the earth, I can feel her.


113. His disciples said to him, "When will the kingdom come?"

"It will not come by watching for it. It will not be said, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Rather, the Father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, and people don't see it."

108. Jesus said, "Whoever drinks from my mouth will become like me; I myself shall become that person, and the hidden things will be revealed to him."
S
70. Jesus said, "If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you. If you do not have that within you, what you do not have within you [will] kill you."


88. Jesus said, "The messengers and the prophets will come to you and give you what belongs to you. You, in turn, give them what you have, and say to yourselves, 'When will they come and take what belongs to them?'


91. They said to him, "Tell us who you are so that we may believe in you."

He said to them, "You examine the face of heaven and earth, but you have not come to know the one who is in your presence, and you do not know how to examine the present moment."


Jesus said, "Lucky is the lion that the human will eat, so that the lion becomes human. And foul is the human that the lion will eat, and the lion still will become human."

And a slave cannot serve two masters, otherwise that slave will honor the one and offend the other.

Nobody drinks aged wine and immediately wants to drink young wine.


If they ask you, 'What is the evidence of your Father in you?' say to them, 'It is motion and rest.'"

51. His disciples said to him, "When will the rest for the dead take place, and when will the new world come?"

He said to them, "What you are looking forward to has come, but you don't know it."

24. His disciples said, "Show us the place where you are, for we must seek it."

He said to them, "Anyone here with two ears had better listen! There is light within a person of light, and it shines on the whole world. If it does not shine, it is dark."

17. Jesus said, "I will give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, what no hand has touched, what has not arisen in the human heart.

33. Jesus said, "What you will hear in your ear, in the other ear proclaim from your rooftops.

After all, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, nor does one put it in a hidden place. Rather, one puts it on a lampstand so that all who come and go will see its light."



Jesus said, "The Pharisees and the scholars have taken the keys of knowledge and have hidden them. They have not entered nor have they allowed those who want to enter to do so.

As for you, be as sly as snakes and as simple as doves."
When you strip without being ashamed, and you take your clothes and put them under your feet like little children and trample them, then [you] will see the son of the living one and you will not be afraid."

For this reason I say, if one is whole, one will be filled with light, but if one is divided, one will be filled with darkness."

Drawing from the void , learned in church it's possible that
multiple people can draw into a shared creative flow.

You know how Henry Emerson Foster wrote a book called 'How to be a Real Person'? Translated into it's original terms, that means 'How to be a Genuine Fake.' Because the person is the mask, the 'persona' worn by actors in Greco-Roman drama. They put a mask on their face which had a megaphone-shaped mouth which projected the sound in an open- air theater. So the 'dramatis persona' at the beginning of a play is the list of masks, and the word 'person,' which means 'mask,' has come to mean the real you. 'How to be a Real Person.' Imagine.

Watts:
a person with a very strong and different and unique personality is not an isolated person, but a person extremely aware of his identity with the rest of the universe.



What is unseen is eternal.



God is waiting on us to come to him. .

But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.



Common kundalini symptoms are inner or external noises, such as roaring, ringing, voices, waterfalls. The individual may experience feelings of grandeur, believe that they are godlike, that they may have an important mission or message to relay. Back pain and burning energy shooting up the spine and exhaustion, all of which can be confused with chronic fatigue, and uncontrollable leg movements that may be misdiagnosed as restless leg syndrome. Random vocalisations such as laughter or uncontrollable singing. Euphoria, and periods of intense depression. A deep feeling of not belonging and wanting to return 'home'. Experiences of alternate realities and altered states of consciousness, an impossible feeling of connection with the world and other people
