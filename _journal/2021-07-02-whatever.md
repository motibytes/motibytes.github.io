Love is faint and love is faint. Sense it, catch, hold, but do not touch too sharply,
else fan blades slice fog into free form again,

Often the dust must settle to steal this glimpse,
and when you start to see it,
hold your gasp, turn your breath into whispers, be ever still as crystal palaces,
for the one careless gust will startle the sound, and your sight might again run
away into the night until your cold stare softens.
