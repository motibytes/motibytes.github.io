# RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

3. (Optional) Say, "Jesus Christ, I invite you into my heart."

4. (Optional) To keep this power (and according to Christians be saved for all eternity), say, "Jesus Christ, I accept you as my Lord and Savior, thank you for dying for my sins."

# Accessing More Infinite Power

To find joy, say this in your own words, "Lord God, thank you for (something)". Repeat as needed.

To access peace, kindness, freedom, power, or any other resource aligned with love, just ask for it.

# Restarting Life

To free yourself of your burdens and pains and old ways, seek out a church to give you a water baptism.
This will put you back into the moment, and free you from the past.
