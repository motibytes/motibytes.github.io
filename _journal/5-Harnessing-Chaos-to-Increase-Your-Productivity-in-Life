specifically chaos

Harnessing Chaos to Increase your Productivity in Life

On a spiritual level, I believe in upholding and promoting order. When I speak
of order, I am alluding to sanity, to safety, to stability, to grounding,
to what can be trusted. When I speak of order I am speaking to that which leads to love. This has
traits of harmony, of goodness, of peace.

We all want these things. We want control, we want comfort, we want to have
a sense of security. As we pursue these in life, we also find the cost
of these endeavors. That to rest in a state of stillness, we are not accomplishing
our goals. Now we are stuck in a place where we need rest, but we can barely
rest because when we try to, this action is contradicting our desires that
require action to fulfill.
