When are we going to finally talk about this.
This one observable phenomenon always transpiring all around us.
The one thing we see every moment but have difficulty putting into
thought.
We aren't really here! None of us are really here! Every person you look at,
we all know, we all can see that we're basically living as if we were wearing
blindfolds to the world we exist in.
Observe any person's life and you can see that they are the master composer,
creator, god of their own fate, reality, life. You can look at someone and
see that the only thing that is stopping them is fear, that nothing truly
holds them back but themselves, that their view of their responsibility in
their story is complete tunnel vision, acting as if they have no power or
choice in most events transpiring around them when the truth is, fear
is what controls them.
We all know that there is no set path, right way to live, no one career to follow,
no one path to take, and yet we fight to do things the way others say is right.
But we know no one is. That no one has it figured out.

But how we're not really here.. it's so much more than that. It's a dream.
It really is a dream. We really are as conscious as zombies. In a fog. No
matter how hard we try our perspectives are so limited that we can only ever
catch a momentary glimpse of our lives and even ourselves. Psychology tells us
we aren't even in control of most of our actions because most of us run as
slaves to our habits. We're all lost, whether it be caught in a whirlwind of
emotions, or a cold empty void. And we all know all of this,
as if it's common sense.
It's common sense that we are wakewalking through life.
Somehow that seems far more important than we make it.


But the illusion is so much more than that. Because we convince ourselves.
That reality is hard and concrete, that you work pay your bills go to sleep.
that everything is fixed and stone and real. but the more you observe the lives
of others, the deeper you look, the more you pay attention to what happens
behind the scenes, between the lines, you can see that what you are perceiving
happening in this reality is a grand illusion. This world is not the television
program, school curriculum we have been educated to believe.

What we believe is happening, everything we think is happening, everything on the
surface external state of reality is not the true status of affairs.
We build our lives, build our walls, our things, our phones, our treasures and trinkets,
as a sort of constant daily eternal reminder that this is our life, that this is who we are,
that this makes us, us, but pick anything up, pick apart any belief, and you find that it isn't
you, it's nothing. It's an illusion.

And we know its an illusion. We keep trying on different illusions as if they were personal outfits to wear,
keep trying them on and trying them on until we find ones that fit well, ones that we like, ones that we
want to keep holding on to and believing, illusions that are worth believing and pretending are real.
For example you hold on to a conclusion that someone loves you, until something shakes and shatters that belief.
And how upset do you become when that belief shatters? How upset do you become when others break the
glass of the illusions you live under? Why?  Because we stick to illusions that are most comfortable and
the least painful. We're all just running from pain and willing to delude ourselves to keep that image raised
like a magical barrier shield. The only things we hate are everything that challenges our view of ourselves.
Our villains are the parts of us we hide from. What we're really all hiding from is truth, and the
truth that none of this is real. That everything we hear and perceive and sense is a lie created by our
own minds.
