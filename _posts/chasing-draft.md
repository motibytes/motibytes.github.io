They said it was about saving the one.

Don't you see? You don't need me. I need you. I need to help you. I need to help you to justify my existence, to convince me I'm supposed to be here. To give these moments meaning. To give me proof, to let me believe that by walking in faith I can change the course of ones life. To let me know I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. To let me know that I have not failed. That I'm walking on the line. I rely on you to rely on me. We're two parts of a duet sharing a dance.  

I want to save you and I don't know how. I understand now why a god would desire freedom of choice. I can see that I cannot help by giving you what you think you want. Even stability, a home, income, could not help you, not in the way I want to.
