something changed after the white house incident,
I still haven't identified what exactly
[10:20 PM] woodrow-wilson: People ready for the chaos to be over?
[10:21 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: my working theory is that the u.s. government had been using information/propaganda for decades to provide the belief that the State was essentially impenetrable,
and we all subconsciously believed that,
and the white house incident showed a shocking reality that this isn't the case,
which brings up a lot of questions people are not willing to look at,
the fundamental belief that "I can not change this country because my government is concrete therefore I am not responsible for my country" may have been shaken in the subconscious mind.
[10:21 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: my second working theory is that hope for 2021 being stable was shattered by the white house incident
[10:22 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: but i have no fucking idea.
[10:23 PM] woodrow-wilson: Lol most statements should end with that but I hear you. I’d honestly like to think the same but we’ll see
[10:23 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: yep.
[10:25 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: the parallel i'm drawing here was when we had mass protests after a hurrican some years ago, and people were waiting for the white house and obama to comment on the incident, and got complete radio silence as our answer.

essentially providing the message that we were so powerless that we were not even worth the government commenting to us.
I am feeling that same kind of reaction here.
[10:25 PM] woodrow-wilson: Honestly surprised nothings happened since and that it didn’t lead to another “insurrection” or a deeper level of police state
[10:25 PM] woodrow-wilson: Yeah ditto that’s what that $600 must’ve felt like to a lot of people
[10:26 PM] woodrow-wilson: Like here take this hope it helps
[10:26 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: i didn't consider that being part of the message, that's true it does give that same tone
[10:27 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: wow. that is sickening.
[10:28 PM] woodrow-wilson: The analogy I heard is getting a quarter tip as a waitress is more insulting than not leaving a tip. It means you thought about it and said fuck you as opposed to just moving on
[10:29 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: unfuckingreal.
[10:30 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: i don't like being the paranoid crier of the future, but these are the actions and messages of a state that promptly militarizes itself against the people within a few years
[10:30 PM] The Great Divenie Mils💚✨🧞✨: unless history lies, which it never does
