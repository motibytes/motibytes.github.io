I create what I see, and my vision becomes me,
if I focus on an image that I have made and blame another for it, 
It thrives and I make myself  victim, if I own what I see and have "become"
 I can recycle the energy back inside of me and form a new me. I am my own source
 and am ultimately responsible for all that I see and experience.
