As I rise, and I Will rise, I will not participate in any established way.
Our cultures and systems have moved in a direction where we listen to the voices
that have positioned themselves as an absolute authority to be heard. We create
and raise up figures that we listen to, figures that present themselves as okay.

We somehow end up staking blind trust into who we choose to listen to, which is
instead ignorance, we dont want to have to think critically, we want the answers.

This is inescapable as the single mandatory requirement for a voice to be heard
in this age is for it to be from an infallible source, from one who has their life
together, whose word and wisdom is without fault. We will not settle for any less.

Because of this choice we as people buy into an illusion that we knew wasn't true
from the start, we require the illusion. Collectively we know and we understand that
no one in this life has it figured out any more than anyone else.
Yet as soon as a voice of authority presents itself, we accept it, as it is the only
voice we will accept.

When every guru, every teacher leads those who are listening to to wisdom that is
off the mark, we wonder how we could have been wrong about this person.

I will make a name for myself. I will not participate in any established way.
I have answers, I don't have all the answers. I am flawed. I fall. I fail. Just
like everyone else. I am not here to give perfect wisdom. I am here to share
my experiences and what I have found, on a road to mastery of life, myself, and
my craft.
