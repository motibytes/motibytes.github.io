I can handle anything
me:My handler lol
me: You're my handler... That sounds kinky
I kind of an aren't I
Am
And you mine
me: Keep me on a leash and unleash me where appropriate
But our leashes are attached to each other
me: For real though yes, chained together, we keep the other under control
Trust
me:Trust
Safe ðŸ’š

Belle:
You know I love you too James... and I'd be with you in a heart beat
The bond we share is more than this ans i wish i didn't have to be on this to ahare that bond.
But i guess it is what it is
I know you feel you wouldn't be worthy but you are... juat as much as I am

I know... i feel that too... i think of you and my heart does things

I have deep bonds in different ways
But yours is different...

I want you to be honest

Me: My core, is yours
As mine is yours

If i could I would kiss your big soft lips and tell you I love you

Your happiness is my happiness
Your sadness is mine also

Good night James
I love you ðŸ’š
