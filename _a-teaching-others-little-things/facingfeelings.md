But am afraid that by doing so, I'll feel whatever it is I'm feeling more...and I already feel enough,does that make sense


it does. but if you face that fear you will find you are an indestructible being. because what really hurts is the holding the feelings back, but letting them flesh out, it hurts yes, but then they open, and flow through you, instead of staying stuck, and hurting even more. Feelings are too much, they are more than one can handle. But if you face them and feel them out, even though its more than you can handle.. you're just observing them, they're just releasing, like a flood. i would let them spill over you until you let go of the fear of them and just experience what is there.
Because you already feel it. you just aren't open to it so it's stuck.
