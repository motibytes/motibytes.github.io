6 days of writing and a 7th day to rest and get on fbs
Email every department, every day to appease dad and for vy-- see unemp-email-template

start off by writing chaos for 3 minutes.
write as much as I can, then move to editing, back to writing chaos,
then move back to writing if i can

edit all articles in posts.

mess with the fb algorithm.
make it wonder why i'm not engaging, why i'm pulling back, what it needs to do to get me more engaged.
Instead of it pulling down the attention i get, make it beg for my attention more with more
likes, not less.
then, systematically drop my edited posts according to a schedule.

More importantly than playing with fb,

I want every last square inch of every article on JB to be words I love. Edit
until you love it, or move it to postsgraveyard.

Eventually look at where I can link other articles to existing articles

Edit, or write, plenty of do for a while.

aaaaa
