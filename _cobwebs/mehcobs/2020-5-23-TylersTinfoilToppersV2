I don't brush my teeth because other people tell me to,
I brush them because I know that if I do not, my teeth will rot.
I don't wash my hands because others tell me to, I wash them
because I understand the concept of germs.

Now, I am not going to wear a tinfoil hat because anyone tells me to.
Not because I am worried about anything. I wear one of these hats because
I understand that ultraviolet rays are bad for my body in ways we don't even
know yet, and I choose to take a minor precaution against that.

I'm not going to live in the woods or cover my body in tinfoil to avoid
radiation, but choosing to wear a hat I would wear anyway that happens to
have shielding from ultraviolet radiation is something I can choose to do,
not because anyone tells me I should or shouldn't, but because I can make
my own choices about how I want to take care of my own body.

I don't ever want to scare anyone into buying anything, and I don't ever
want you to do something because you were simply listening to what others
were doing. I do however want to provide this product to those who would
also like to make the same conscious choice I have made.
