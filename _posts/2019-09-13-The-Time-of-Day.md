<!-- The world rewards the listener. -->

People struggle to connect, and it almost seems
the more they communicate the more isolated they feel.
The world isn't communicating because the world isn't listening.
We think that if we say more, if we act differently,
that is how we will be recognized.

# Yet, the world doesn't need more voices. 

People need someone to listen.
When we listen, a strange phenomenon occurs. The less one speaks, it seems the more others will open up. They stop talking about the weather. They don't
attempt to force a meaningless interaction. They start to open up.

Maybe it's because when listening, you clear space for them to think,
when they stop feeling like you are waiting for your turn to talk.
They start to trust you, for no reason other than that they can tell
that you are focused on them, that the conversation is for them and
not for yourself. Listening makes them feel safe enough to express themselves.
The conversation is no longer a mandatory socially correct engagement.
It actually flows naturally. The interaction never ends awkwardly, because it ends when it is ready to end. Lingering in the air is a mutual, unspoken sensation of satisfaction, that comes only when it feels like the moment
**mattered**. Whether it mattered or not, remembered or not, maybe that isn't
for us to know.
