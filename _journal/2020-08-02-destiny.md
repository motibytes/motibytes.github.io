I am not sure which I am afraid of more. Of not having a destiny,
or having a destiny beyond that which I have the ability to hold on to.
I feel the possibility exists that my life might change so rapidly in the blink
of an eye, that it becomes unrecognizable to me. If I was on top of the world,
truly on top of the world, I fear that I would not be able to rationalize my
life. I would be in an unfamiliar world, one that I do not understand.
I can see myself being suspended in a perpetual state of disbelief, continually
trying to comprehend that my life was real. This is why we run from possibility.
This is why we run from the unknown.
