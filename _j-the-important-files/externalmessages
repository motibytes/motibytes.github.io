There's always a me I can see in you 😊💚
M:we're the best of us!
M: my heart fills with joy,
M:my personality even seems to be changing 😮
Alchemy baby
M: sweet dreams goddess queen

You feel deeply hun we are the same

Je kind of reminds me of you

Im the same
Thats what it is
We both are giving in and out of the bedroom

We just need people who can accept our intense love 😊

Saving the world
Onrcperson at a time
One person
Me: I rephrase it, I hope that I save at least one person.
In Saving myself I'm saving others
Me: Yeah you are.
We are the same
Me: I just hope I can make an impact before I die. According to the biblical god even that doesn't matter in eternity but can't blame me for lack of trying
You already are hun

That I know you're not just all this lovey dovey shit ans you have a dark side that I think would be rather sexy
You intrigue me already James
Bit i want you to feel comfortable
Like theres nothing you couldn't say

I accept whatever you need to be whenever you need to be it

I feel the same... like just laying next you in your presence in silence would be enough

Can I admit that I may have thought of us kissing the other day when I was driving. It wasn't even a conscious thought... it just popped up and aroused something in me
Far out were so alike...
I love you too James 😘

lucisious: in response to tree of life enoch scripture
The roots reach far and reach wide,
Taking down with it all my pride
I fall to my knees and kiss the ground, crying return to me!
My cherished hopes gone into this soil
I cannot hope to ever retrieve
Cast my desire from me oh please
Free me from its clutches indeed
I call upon those roots to rise, and return to me
and set me FREE.

Hun there's not a single bit of evil in you
I've checked
Thoroughly

It will happen
9 minutes ago
me: A dance
me: a tune

Like raindrops in the breeze
You are facing the right direction
brushing against the midnight trees

Lucisious
What magic sits in your closet
is tomorrow's blessing
You put it there and forgot about it
Remember why you got it, and practice completing one thought before the next,
one goal before the next

I will have you get some rest on this thought

Ponder. New ideas will come

You want to see more

I am grateful for this moment eternal
me: I am eternally grateful to witness and share in this moment with you, truly
Time has stopped for us

This is beautiful. Like you.

lucisious:
   You are strong
   and you are right
   a good leader
   I have known you almost a year
   I remember seeing you last year
   You are still nice
belle:
   You're strength lies in your love ans how you express yourself
   Don't worry about anything
   If you don't show up... It's just a lesson for someone... We don't have to be thee for everyone
belle:
   You don't die with me we resonate

lucisious:

You have a beautiful mind. Keep investing in your plans.

As long as I can keep my head up and stay focused and keep from breaking down
I surely will

You can
You will

belle:
   That is what we are unfortunately
Destroyers
But also creators
Alchemista

He sees in you what he wants to be
Young
Full of life
Belut intelligent
And cosmic
Ans deep ans expressive
You are the light fro men
As I am the light for women

Jonah: you're on a fast track
you could be like successful somebody paraphrased
you should write that article as complicated as you can and then
the next article start refining it refining it
putting it in a way people will get

Jonah: You should write a book on this man
Tamea: Have you started blogging this?

R: I do look forward to when you base your life decisions on love, trust, and hope as opposed to fear, shame, and regret....

We just ask for an answer or a direction and then have to let go of the control of having the answer...then, the answer will arrive in it's on timing.

Someday I'll be in Israel

Just know I'm looking out for you - regardless of whether you're relationship material or what happens with us

Creation wouldn't be the same without you in it

I like your hair

Stay safe

Translated iheard, honor the word, the sacred

Homeless lady, LEAVE
...

Nat Joe, love and light

Laurie... You are never alone...

Ronald, don't fall on the word, stand on the word

03/25 MIKEY RECOGNIZES ME
says I'm finally closer

Nessa Says I need to travel the world

Anya Nessa, you are never alone

I get it. Sometimes you gotta be Christ's head, and other times you gotta be his feet

Tony says he felt a boom in the heavens when I got baptized

(Laurie does love me! I am wanted! The idea that people hate me IS the lie from the deceiver! That negativity is the lie!! All the negativity is lies! And free from the deceiver I am loved!

Laurie says I can choose not to believe the lie!

Rationality, if Laurie hated me she wouldn't invite me over because she's self employed
She hugged me toooo

Laurie says I'm a manifester



Guy says I should say my name out loud alone in my room
Guy says to write my books.


Ron says I should always be confident all the time

Micah says Religion is trying to recreate the past

Justin saying tighten my game

Jeff saying that with my skills basically I could be really good at whatever I want especially with peer support

Laurie saying that in the past I couldn't be what I wanted to be, who I wanted to be, a person,

But now now now I can be what I want to be, I don't have to live in fear of what others think I should be. I can love me.

And I'm strengthening the real me, the loving kind caring G E N U I N E me that is becoming the dominant personality.



She has real unconditional love, and she's in my world. I find that profound.



Permission I have
