#10/13 belle

Im sorry im having a hard time after seeing your meat suit... I literally just
wanna throw you down on the ground ans have my way with you...
that's my ego talking. Let's carry on

We are bonded

If you were in my physical vicinity you'd be in trouble


belle:

Me: cannot help wishing I could share connectivity with you. Not sex, not fucking, but like. Something that I don't think exists I think lol. A safe togetherness.
Me: Can't help it.

I was just thinking about you hugging me
As I lay here on my bed
That was telepathy

Me: Really wish I could be there for you in that way. In a holding way. In a, we're together and I care about you way.

You are
We are...

   Why i can slip into your room ana lay next to you as you sleep
I feel the soft rise your chest
Your sweet breath on my face
The softness of yoir caramel skin
You smile in your sleep
Always Im.in your heart

---its really a lot to see to see the christian's im with, the families, underlying darkness present itself and express its colors,
setting the right intentions...but there's some things that are just unreal to see expressed

the envy that they need to be better than others, they must. they must. they must. To see someone have any joy or peace or be doing better than them without god in any way is the source of all of their resentments...
These are things I had realized they believed,
But now I'm actually hearing this clearly coming out of their mouths, it all rises to the surface
belle (after talking her through blocking)
Thanks for allowing me to express it... Not many I can do that to

In a song, there are pauses between each sound. Without those pauses, there is no song.
If each sound were a moment that you connect with someone,
If during each ' pause between the sound', you go on an adventure to find one of the great secrets,
are you really alone?
