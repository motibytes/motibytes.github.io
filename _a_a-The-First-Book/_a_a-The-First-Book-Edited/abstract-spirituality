Abstract Spirituality

I envision spirituality as taking the perspective of an abstraction of reality, then expressing this depiction, this imaginative art, as thought in form.
I see art as an active participation of gratitude and a worshipping celebration of the value that is seen within reality.
The giver gives the gift of reality, the observer gives the gift of sight to acknowledge the given gift.

In this sense, spirituality is an active, appreciative, post-processing of existence.

I have wondered if the quest for the orderly Father God is man's insatiable need and calling to access perfection in art, that inner yearning that cannot settle for imperfection,
the unknown blots of ink scattered across his canvas. Is it this need that if not kept in check will attack the imperfect in oneself and others, the rejection of his own God's creation,
unable to accept life in its entirety? Is he unable to rationalize how a perfect god could create such imperfection, unable to accept that within him that is seen as imperfect?
I do not attempt to rationalize this personally, but I do pay attention and hold space for that dominating, authoritative part of myself.

The more I think from this perspective, the more I become convinced that all of mankind, all of consciousness' ambition, all of self, is in the pursuit and expression of art in
peculiar, abstract forms and thoughts. A mental image is painted that we are painters within a painting, creating one great masterpiece and coloring in every last square until
its completion, when there is no darkness that has not been seen, when all of the all has been brought into light, visualized onto a portrait.
