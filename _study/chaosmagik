Magick can be worked quite easily once one learns to
re-believe in innocence, simplicity and direct inspiration.  Why
use a memorized invocation, including divine names and
words of power when one can get better and livelier results
by speaking from the heart plus a dose of freestyle chaos
language and chanting? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

no difference between will and universe energy
===>>>>
The experience of the universe as a place filled with unlimited
potentiality, and gorgeous beyond description to boot, is typical of many
altered states of mystical perception.  Dzog Chen maintains that this is
the actual nature of the universe, a place of limitless light and
potentiality.  Tibetan Buddhism is called the Vajrayana after this
assertion, for Vajra means diamond, and the universe is a diamond web of
dynamic interconnections.  Diamonds, in tantric tradition, are the
crystallized sperm of the gods.

The task of the magician who accepts the mystic's description of the
universe, or if not that of the mystic, the model of the universe proposed
by quantum mechanics, for there is little to differentiate either model
from one another, is to deprogram himself, to annihilate the
discriminatory mind sets of rational thinking, the primary intellectual
artefact of civilization.  For once this level of consciousness is reached,
once the conscious and the non conscious mind are working together, then
there is no difference between the will of the magician and the movement
of the stream of energy that is the universe.

more on neither neither
===
The Neither-Neither principle asserts that there is no truth
		anywhere that is not balanced by an equally true opposite
		somewhere, and there is only perspective and circumstance
		to determine which seems more true at any given time.  To
		apply this principle to conjuring, wait until you are absolutely
		positive something is true, then search for its opposite.  When
		you find it, oppose it to your truth and let them annihilate
		one another as well as they may.Any residue should oppose to its
		opposite, and so on until your truth has been dismembered and
		the passion converted into undirected energy - free belief.  By
		applying the Neither-Neither we can gut the meaningless
		convictions that obsess us every day and use the power
		released to cause the changes we desire. (38)

more sigils creation advice
===

		If you desire matters of dream magick you could draw your
		sigil on paper, fold it into a paper boat, and send it off on a
		river, stream, or pond.  The water destroys the body and
		receives the idea.  You might draw the sigil in earth colours
		on your skin and dance until youUve sweated it off, or form the
		shape in berries, food for the birds. You could draw it in the
		earth with a stick and leave it for the rains, or give it, drawn
		on paper, to the fire.  You might even feed on it.  Ink can be
		washed off and drunk with water (use a non-toxic sort), and
		some signs can be drawn or baked into cakes or bread. (39)

basically we don't know why it works we allow it to happen by means
we don't know how.
===
We use sigils to bypass adverse conditions, to avoid the
		censorship of identity, to achieve our will through avenues we
		do not even know about.
      If you think about results while
      		transmitting, you effectively bind your mind to find a solution
      		along the desired channels, and this is frequently a hindrance,
      		as Tthe desired channelsU are usually the very approach that
      		does not function.  Our conscious selves are often the greatest
      		obstacle to the sigilUs manifestation.

forget sigils to reduce self doubt in results... INTERESTING ON SELF DOUBT
====
The assertion that Sigils need to be forgotten after they have been
charged means that sigils are not appropriate for certain magickal
intentions.  For example, a sigil to accomplish a goal which is  long term
and daily obsession may not work if the magician is unable to release the
obsession into the magickal act.  That is to say, if the magician develops a
sigil to gain a promotion at work, to get good grades at school, or to
attract a sexual partner, if the day after charging of the sigil the
magician continues to obsess about his lousy job, his worsening grades or
his complete inability to get laid, it is unlikely that the sigil will work.
To give a personal example, it is my wish to actualize a much more
powerful computer system.  I have sigilized this intention.  Unfortunately,
every time a computer catalog comes in the mail (almost daily), I see the
computer system I want and I wonder when my sigil will work.  I wonder
if it is going to work.  I chastise myself because I am thinking about it
working.  My mind then proceeds to create all manner of confliucting
thoughts circling around this topic.  Does magick really work?  Do I
deserve a better computer system?  Was my father right when he thought I
would be a failure?  Perhaps if I just mentally shove at the obstacle
preventing the actualizing of the sigil it will work.  Perhaps I should do
the sigil again?  Perhaps I should charge it harder?  Clearly, this is Rlust
for resultS, not to mention fear of success and the multiple dysfunctions
of personal psychology. In this event, another magickal technique, such as
the creation of a servitor or a sacrifice to a godform may be more
appropriate.  Sigilizing is unlikely to work while I am obsessed with a
new computer system.

clearly influenced by
psychoanalytic theory, particularly Jung, and Spare's insistence on the
primacy of the sexual impulse owes not a little to Freud.  Of course
Spare's system works if one believes in psychoanalysis or not, not so
much because the existence of a deep unconscious, collective or
otherwise, is any more provable than the existence of a soul, but because
it subverts the conscious mind and the failure tapes of normal
consciousness.  Culturally defined consensual belief structures work
tirelessly against the actualization of  magickal intentions, requiring, at
the least, refuge in plausible explanations for apparently abnormal events
or at least some kind of explanation.  Thus unusual events such as the
actualization of a spell for success in oneUs job, for example, are justified
by the collective consciousness as something that was bound to happen
anyway, or less plausibly, the inevitable result of increased self-
confidence that the magick spell brought about in the magician.  If these
explanations are insufficient then perhaps the grace of God, angelic
intervention, demonic agency, or just good luck can be proffered.  It is the
stance of modern chaos magick, however, that *******************************
none of these explanations
are necessary, except perhaps in that they increase the  ability of the
magician to engineer belief structures.  ******************************
But the engineering of belief
structures is a poor substitute for their suspension.  If quantum
mechanics is correct, human beings live in a universe of mind numbing
complexity, at an order of magnitude far greater than the ability of the
human mind to comprehend.  If this is the case, and we live in a quantum
flux of unlimited potentiality then all things are equally possible, all
beliefs equally true, or, as Hassan Ibn Al Sabah, Le Vieux de Montagne, is
alleged to have said, Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted.  If this is
the case the need of human psychology to explain events is merely another
aspect of the totalitarian dictates of society's consensual belief
structures.

Peter Carroll postulated
a psychohistorical theory that asserted that magickal shamanism, a
simple  and fluid form of magick based upon a mystical awareness  of the
interdependence of all phenomena, degrades into paganism, and with the
growth of religious forms magick is relegated to a priestly caste, who,
over a period of time lose access to the magickal current and degrade into
formalism.
