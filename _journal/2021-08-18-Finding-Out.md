A teacher of mine put identity to me like this. "We're just exploring. We're just finding out. We don't know yet. We're just finding out." I've found that when I interact with people who say this sort of thing, I feel like I can breath. I feel like, they see me as a "happening that has not yet happened and is happening now", and it relieves me of the burden of my self-image. I've only been gifted this phenomenon a few times. I hope to retain it one day.
