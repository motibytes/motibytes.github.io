But image comes from imagination. We have mental images, unformed and unexpressed, that we then bring into form and creation. What was an image in our mind becomes created and out-pictured in our reality.

I believe that we are always being made in the Image of God. God is having a thought, a mental image of creation, and that thought is being made into us. We are at all times being made from the unformed image of God, into formed output.

See how this is not just an image, this is God's *own* image, it is his own. As it is his, when his image changes, we change.

If there is no God with which to have an unformed mental image, then there is no being made into form.

If this sounds hard to wrap your head around, reality is even more mind-boggling. We are made in God's likeness, so we too are capable of having a mental image that is made into being, a mental image that affects even our own being.


Consider that,
God is imagining that you are a being that is imagining your own existence and by doing so making your own reality into form,
while you are capable of imagining that all of this is happening.
