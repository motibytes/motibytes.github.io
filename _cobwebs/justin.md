To Whom It May Concern,

Justin Indiveri is a good man with a good heart, a light that is continually striving to make the right choices and is proactively making positive changes in his life.

I grew up with Justin. He has suffered serious traumas, sexual abuse in
childhood and has struggled with mental health. In a way, the young adult Justin was still the child that needed to feel safe. In his past, paranoia of others led him to make reactions out of fear, unable to trust the world around him or reach out to connect with those who could support him. I will say I have never known Justin to carry bad intentions.

Prison, hard life experiences and breakdowns have had a significant impact on Justin. I have grown up around good people and bad, including people who carry ill will in their hearts and most often escape justice and the law. Justin is not one of those people. Prison often turns individuals hateful, molds them into repeat offenders of our criminal justice system, or breaks them. Most people who return from prison, it's as if they lost something. For Justin, he found something in his experiences instead. He grew from that time, and chose to see it as a positive in his life.

The Justin I know today knows who he is. He chooses to see best in others and in life. He has a heart of appreciation and is supportive and empathetic to those around him, bringing them up, encouraging and motivating them. He has battled his demons. He's chosen to keep himself involved in and is building a support network of positive influences, is proactively working wherever he can find it, and is maintaining a stable living situation. He makes the right choices and avoids unhealthy situations daily. His life enthusiasm, joy, respectfulness, and mindset are inspiring to me and others. I think Justin is in a place where he can keep rising higher, building his life up and growing in a positive way, strengthened with people who care about and value him, so that he might have a positive impact on many more lives.

Regards,
