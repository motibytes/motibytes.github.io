I don't know how I keep doing this to myself or how I could be so forgetful,
but I allowed myself to completely get wound up like a rubber band ball again,
and the difference between how awake, aware, alive, okay and like myself I feel when I look back into presence meditation,

When I access presence, I enter a different state of being, I'm not the person I thought I was.
I wake up, and all of the sudden, my self-image has changed. It isn't the one I created.
It's just another person. All of the pressure, everything I said I was or had to do or the ways I acted or what I could be,
I suddenly remember that none of that is real. The door to the possibility of doing things differently opens up again,
and I can see who I am right now and not who I was. Suddenly I can "see" again, access ideas again, of all that could be,
and instead of feeling like I am weighed down and crushed by an invisible force, I am relieved and instead filled with 10 thousand zaps of microelectricity and stimulus. I remember what it's like to smell and take in a breath of fresh air through my lungs and down into my chest again.

I start to see what I could do

I'd like my next blog to have a page that is only wellbeing resources, no opinion, no filler, nothing that isn't something you would want to live your life without.

in any case, i dont know why i cant remember to turn back to the presence thing, and it's perhaps it's because it's impossible to remember to go there,
because my mind can't remember what it's like, because it's not a place my mind can go to travel to. My mind and thoughts get left behind, and the thoughts try to pipe up and express worries, but once they've been escaped long enough, suddenly the thoughts have had a change in attitude, suddenly they are now excitable and full of spark and charisma and vying for my attention like a little kid that wants to show you something. 'hey look at this look at this!"

and this is when it becomes vividly apparent that the person, truly, is not these voices they identified with. For a little while that deception has broken.

but my plan is to start meditating on presence while I do some boring stuff
But I have had to break out of a lot of ideas i was raised with that prevent access. And those ideas come back and get me again.
they become a tool of the thoughts to lasso around and convince one to be running on a tune.

most of those ideas sound good or ethical on paper or like they'd protect one, and most of them have justice and judgement involved,
but they all say the same message underneath and low key, "it's not okay for you to be, right now. you need to do something."

precious burning candle of a heart, what a perfect and lovely thing of love you are, please stop leaving me. please stay. ill sing you any song you want.
