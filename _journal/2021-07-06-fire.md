I'm wondering if I should burn every piece of my writing I do not love, and I wonder when the fire is over, if there will be a survivor.

And you know now that our focus will tune to love, real love, my love, not the world's love, my love of looking at the world with eyes of beauty, with eyes of marvel, as I move in a dance of mystery and sacred devotion and childish wonder, of perceiving a wonderful brightly colored life.

And I feel these burning pains, birth pains, that in my fear of losing love, I will burn out all of me, all of my false loves, all of my thoughts, my being, myself will die again, it will not be found on the other side of the heart's surrender, the selfish sacrifice.
