i guess it was a creation of my mind because i was able to "direct" the thoughts the same way i normally would, but first "she" who had a perfect voice to me that sounded like it was also me, then I searched for a "he", and heard a perfect male voice, then focused on merging the two and when I did I felt this wholeness in my heart.
even if it was only in my head, it was not normal thinking it was an altered state of consciousness, my normal false construction of my reality that I couldn't see is always there it melted.

for what they said, I was able to hear them say they loved me, cared about me were there for me, and when they (or I) said my name, it melted my heart to the core. like when you hear what you've needed to hear for years.
I then kinda took command of that ship and wanted to just live like that from that point on. but being an altered state.. it was temporary.

it was shiv-shakti as an entity, not just an energy, whether or not it was my minds conception of what shiv-shakti would be or if it was actually the goddess shakti, a personification of shiva, of divine mother sophia or whatever name.

but specifically i identified it as shakti as a more youthful divine personality as opposed to an older wiser personality

it's almost as if it was charged with that divinely, but it was also much more me,
than I am.
it provided contrast to this image i had of myself that was definitely not me


yeah that was all kundalini. ive had a kundalini awakening a few years ago but there was no process or meditation involved it just happened when it was supposed to i guess.


after this experience tonight though i went and swam naked in the dark ocean and i swear i felt the water like i never have before, the water never felt so smooth, and i basically felt like i was the water.
