going well, changing environment to the ocean helped the focus.
complete elimination of fb, tv, media, is forcing to goal.
having a few articles organized is allowing me to jump between them.
Knowing that if I don't do this I'll be looking back at the decision maker seems
to increase my drive to focus.
