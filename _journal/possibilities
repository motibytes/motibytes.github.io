that's where i got to remembering last night, in terms of free will versus a greater will,
that I don't want to try to run the show myself at all, since I can't fathom all possibilities,
I want the will of light/love/god to run this show and pick the best possibilities for me.
So that's where I'm at now is I want to choose into unknown and live in the state of possibility,
to be open to the largest possible amount of blessings coming to me, but also trust in something
 greater than myself to dish out which blessings those are.

  It becomes this almost poetic balance
  of learning 'how to ask', 'what' to ask for, in such a way that has a direction but remains
   open for the largest amount of possibility. For example instead of asking the universe for
   a car, I might instead ask to be granted the wisdom for how to acquire a car, or perhaps
   just ask to have my need for speed fulfilled, opening the potential for that to be answered
   in a way I haven't imagined, that is far better than I could have imagined it.
