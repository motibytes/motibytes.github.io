Imagine your life as a video game. (SECRET: it is)

### 1. Try Again

> You can try again if you fail.

> You have nothing to lose.  

> You have absolutely everything to gain.  

<br>

### 2. No Penalties

> There are no consequences for losing or winning.
> Lose as hard as you can if you like, in order to learn what to do.

> You also can choose not to win. You can aim to simply enjoy the game if you like.

<br>

### 3. No Refresh

> There is no reason to wish you hadn't done something sooner.

> Not having done something is only a lesson and a reminder that you should
be doing something now.

> Wishing you had done something before now does nothing to help you accomplish your objective now.

> You can only choose to keep playing the game and whether or not you will pursue your objective.

### 4. Main Quest

> You are here to complete your story.

> You are here to fulfill your destiny.

> You are free to chase side quests as well.

### 5. NPCs

> Non-Playable Characters are all around you. <br>
> Learn how they work. <br>
> Learn what they like. <br>
> Learn what they want. <br>
> Learn what they need. <br>
> Learn how to give them love, to reap returns of love.<br>
> Destroy them or make them follow you.<br>
> Do not allow them to distract you or surrender.<br>
> Do not sacrifice yourself to become an NPC in order to gain others' acceptance.

### 6. NPCs can Mislead

> NPCs even with the most innocent of intentions can have programming instructions to distract you from your objectives to increase the challenge of your game.

> Keep in mind they may sometimes attempt to stray you from winning the game.

> Keep in mind NPCs are designed to run the world around you. Helping to run the system is not your function.

> Much of what NPCs tell you is based on fear. It is your role as the player to lead them out of fear.

### 7. NPCs Offer Mini Quests

> What NPCs ask of you may or may not be what they need nor the right choice.

> You can do what they ask, or not. It is your choice.

> Your story is not their side plot. Be wary. 		

### 8. Find Your Companions

> There are valuable allies waiting to aid you on your quest.

> Find and join forces with them.

> Listen carefully as many hold secrets, see #14.

### 9. Complete your Directives

> Listen to your core, to your heart.

> Your clearly defined Directives, programming instructions, objectives, purpose, raw talents, fulfilling passions that have always been there for as long as you can remember.

> There may be one, there may be multiple, but they are always there.

> You have always known that is why you are here.		

### 10. Do Not Distract Yourself.

> There are times you will be so afraid of following your Directive that you will attempt to find a false directive.

> You may forget about your original directive or diminish its value to the point that it no longer seems possible or is overshadowed by the false directive.

> You may end up searching for new purposes only to not find them, or settle for (See Law 2.) entertainment, simply enjoying the game.

### 11. No Impossibility

> Fear is the enemy that tells you your Directives are not accomplishable.

> This perceived impossibility to achieve your purpose is a *Lie*.

> Your purpose is accomplishable, it is not too late(see Law 3.), now.

> You would not still be playing the game if it wasn't still possible to win.		

### 12. Feelings are Immersion

> Feelings are enhancements in this game.<br>
> Feelings exist in this world to increase the overall quality of your experience.<br>
> Feelings are meant to be enjoyed to increase the realness of the game.


### 13. Feelings are Distracting/Overwhelming.

> Feelings can sometimes be so immersive that your choices become based off of them.

> Managing your feelings is a key part of winning your game.

> Fearing the incurrence of past painful feelings can hold you back from taking actions now.

> Embracing and facing into your feelings will allow you to continue on.  

### 14. Secrets and Hints are Everywhere.

> Little Hints of wisdom from past players are everywhere in this world.

> Learning to filter and decipher Secrets can drastically cut time and even allow you to skip longer tutorial segments.


### 15. There are Cheat Codes  

> This game is rigged for your benefit.<br>
> Certain values can have a profound impact on your experience.<br>
> Increasing your positive thinking, love, kindness and other traits are overpowered abilities that make the game work in your favor.<br>
> These shortcuts become available to you as a player as soon as you begin looking for them and exponentially increase your Power.

### 16. Hacking

> Advanced players understand that the mind itself is a part of the game, and arguably the most critical part of the game.
It is difficult but advised to reprogram aspects of the mind for the player's benefit.

> Hacking is recommended to redefine what matters, what you care about,
what you want, who you want, who you are, what you do, and so on.

> Your negative or unbeneficial values, emotions, drives, motivations, thinking patterns, traits, sense of identity are all exploitable.

> You can learn from other players on how to accomplish such. Listen but do not
be trusting. Many powerful players skilled in hacking, seemingly helpful,
can be malicious, attempting to harm you to seek control over you or simply to cause harm for evil's sake.

> An additional warning, malicious hacking can be found in all places, including religious, psychological, and spiritual.

### 17. Self

> Finding your Self is a key programming instruction in most players.

> Inner peace, acceptance, love - and in some cases, God - are often acquired in this quest, as such it is recommended to seek it early on.

> Observancy is key. Look outward, look inward. Observe thoughts, feelings, patterns, and actions. Observe what remains after all else is gone.

### 18. You are the Player   

> You are not the character. <br>
> You are playing as the character.<br>
> You are the Player playing the character.		 

### 19. YOU ARE THE PLAYER   

> **You are the Player playing the character.**
