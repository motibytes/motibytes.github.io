We're always seeking the answer for how we can be doing more in the here and now, how we can become the person we know we truly are.

In a sea of information bombarding us from all angles,
there's no shortage of wisdom on "what to do",
yet it's impossible to know who to focus on, what to trust.

Take a step back and go for a drive with me as your sidekick
in The Byterian, as this podcast focuses in deep on the real, from connection to mental health to empowerment and creating a better life, one that we want to live in.
How we can improve genuine communication with each other will be a major focus of future episodes.

I'd love to have you ride along on this journey.
And if you're not planning to listen in, I just want to say if you're at the end of your rope
in life, it really does get infinitely better.

It's been a thrill creating this. The start might be bumpy, but
the best rides usually are!
