MM -
These days I’m often able to sit down and write 5,000 words
or more in a single day. I still feel the same anxiety. I still hear
the same thoughts (“I need to eat first,” “I should take a nap,”
“I’m not in a writing mood right now.”)
But now instead of identifying with these thoughts, I
acknowledge them:
   “I feel nervousness about writing today.”
   “I have the thought that I need to eat first.”
   “I have the thought that I need to take a nap first.”
And then I turn to my Thinking Mind and promptly tell him
that it’s full of shit and that I don’t need a damn thing except
to sit my ass down and start writing.

We all produce excuses and negative emotions involuntarily.
Guess what? That’s NEVER going to change.
You can’t get away from them. None of us can.

What you CAN do is accept them. Defuse from them. And then
act despite them.

When people come to me ask how to “Stop feeling angry,” or
“Stop getting nervous,” this is their problem. As soon as you
try to eliminate a thought or emotion, you make it
stronger.
The more you focus on an emotion, the more powerful it
becomes.

Whenever you feel a strong emotion or thought,
disidentify with it and then take possession of it.
“My boss is not an idiot. But I am having the thought that
my boss is an idiot.”
“I don’t hate my ex-girlfriend. I am feeling hatred toward
my ex-girlfriend.”
“I am not lonely and depressed. I am feeling loneliness
and depression.”
Language is very powerful. Notice when you disidentify
from these emotions and thoughts in this way it: 1)

implies that they’re temporary states, and not permanent
conditions and 2) forces you to take responsibility for
them. They’re nobody’s fault, they just are.

Thank your Thinking Mind for negative thoughts and
emotions.

This is a technique from ACT and it is
effective. It may sound absolutely nuts, but it’s effective
because it FORCES you to accept your negative emotions
instead of fight them.
“Thank you Thinking Mind for feeling nervous before my
date tonight. It will keep me on my toes!”
“Thank you Thinking Mind for being angry at my boss. I
really appreciate how much you care.”
This is going to feel really bizarre – expressing gratitude
towards negative emotions. But I think you’ll find that it
diminishes the power of the thoughts and emotions over
time and actually impels you to take action despite them.

Finally, if you find yourself in the heat of the moment, or
if there’s something that’s really nagging at you, try this
out.
Take something that’s bothered you recently and hold it
in your mind. Maybe it’s your girlfriend nagging you.
Maybe it’s being terrified of talking to that cute girl in
class next to you. Maybe it’s quitting your job.
Distill it into a single sentence, such as, “I feel afraid of
quitting my job.” Or “I feel irritated with my girlfriend.”
Now close your eyes and imagine Bugs Bunny saying it,
while chewing a carrot. Then Mickey Mouse saying it,

while dancing and doing cartwheels. Pretend the
Chipmunks are singing it to you in the form of a
Christmas carol.
Now,

turn it into an image,

maybe your angry girlfriend,
or your broke ass sitting on the curb. Put that image on a
television screen. Make the colors funny, give yourself a
polka dotted suit. Make your girlfriend’s hair into a
bunch of candy canes.
Make the thought look and sound absolutely ridiculous
in your mind. Take your time and play with it. Try to
make yourself laugh.
After you’ve done this for a minute or two, stop. How do
you feel?
Chances are you feel much better about it and the
negative emotion isn’t nearly as potent as it was before.
