four levels or dimensions of reality:

Atziluth, the world of Emanation,
Briah, the world of Creation,
Yetzirath, the world of Formation,
and Assiah, the world of Action.

All these levels contain the same essence, even if expressed with a different quality.
This means that all the things and happenings on one level are not only copied in the one below,
but they must also have a counterpart in the worlds above

God manifested the Sephirot which are a sequence of ten energy fields which keep us protected from the full intensity of His Light.
Each Sephirah has distinctive qualities, properties and lessons to be absorbed and mastered.
The ten Sephirot are the manifestation of states of consciousness,
and they act as transformers as we work with them.
