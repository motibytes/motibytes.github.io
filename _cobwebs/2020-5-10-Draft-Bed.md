Thank you God for this message.

How you can help your world, our world change for the better during COVID-19.

This message isn't just fluff. This is real. And I am sorry, I am truly truly sorry that there is not much real in the world, that we hear so many scams and avoid so many traps because people are willing to deceive others for their own benefit, and I'm sorry for that, I'm sorry we've become so desensitized that the word "truth" has become a falsity, that when talk of change even comes up we want to close our ears and our eyes because analyzing it just becomes overwhelming. I know that and I'm sorry. There is an actual practical plan here to start changing things now. And it is going to take some work. It's good work, and it will feel good, but it is work. If you have been asking what you could be doing right now to help and saying you wish you could do more, I will give you an answer, and after hearing this, you really can never honestly say you didn't know what to do to help, that you were powerless, that there was nothing you could have done, that just won't be true. In asking you to listen to this message, I am appealing to your caring about your world, or your caring about yourself.

We're at a critical turning point in history right now, in a state of changability we will likely never see again. While we as individuals are realizing that we do each have our own stories and can decide what we want to do with our lives, those with finances and control over this world are also making the final moves to concrete and finalize their power. We are unmistakably, each and every one of us are all a critical part of the future now, and your actions do matter.

I want to appeal to any of you that feel that you don't want to help other people. You do. Because if you don't like the world you are living in, that means that you want to live in a better world. I'm not talking about a fantasy disneyland, I'm talking about the kind of world that you personally would want to live in. And helping others will create a better world for you, both in your life, as well as on a global scale. If you think you can't help, or this doesn't apply to your life, you can, and it does. More than likely, right now because of this pandemic you're actually in the perfect position to help.
