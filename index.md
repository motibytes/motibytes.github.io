# I want to change the world.

>And I will. But I could use some help.

<!-- ## What is my mission? -->
<!--My purpose, my calling is-->

# My Mission:

I aim **to create systems of interactive text-based therapeutic resources** available for all to use freely (_optimally while disrupting the established powers that be_).


# But. What does that mean?

It means I want to create programs that change people's perspectives about life, what really matters, and eventually to help them work through trauma.


# My plan:

I'm starting with small projects and building up from there. I started with text-based motivational bots as a small hobby. I'm now designing a program
that walks individuals through making life decisions, their goals, and their calling in life.

<br>

# My motivation:

Really I just want to influence people's lives for the better.

To give people a brighter perspective about life.

And, ideally, to survive while doing so.

( Even more ideally, to mass distribute the most beneficial of the _dominant-American-Psychology-monopoly-name-I-can't-say-here_'s
methods for free, because I find it ethically correct to do so)


# What will I need?

Time. ~~It takes 10,000 hours to master a craft.
Which means I'll need about
10,000 hours total at 10 hours per day is 1000 days, 5 days of the week is 1,400 days, which equates to 3.845 years or just about 4 years and several projects later~~. A lot of time.
I'll need the time to build these projects, and a vast amount of time to
gather existing therapy resources. I need funding to make it through that time.

# And I will do just what exactly?

I will build programs of increasing scope. I plan to take the experience gained along the way to create an intelligence that capable of providing extensive therapy to anyone, perhaps with much more complex work like grief.
I am an _excellent_ independent researcher, and can gain any required skills
and information along the way.

# Basically,

#### I want to take code like this:

```python
   print "What do you mean I'm actually code?"
   print "You want me to help people?"
   if True:
      print "I can't do that!"
```

#### and turn it into this.

```
Nancy Drew,
Let's talk through some of your trauma today.
```

# And well,

I don't want to spend _some_ of my free time doing this,
_-as I was before, dedicating nearly every spare moment I had to this-_
I want to spend _**all**_ of my working hours doing this,
for the rest of my life, and see what grows and where it goes.
Because I care about this. And I think it's worth caring about.
And I know it's possible, and I know it will happen one way or another.

# And. And. And.

I want it to be free.
Like. All the time free.
Not like, _monthly subscription_ "free" or _if you can afford insurance_ "free",
like free free. For ev-er-ey-bo-dy. For like, ever.

<dt>I don't really get it?</dt>
<dd>I don't expect everyone or even very many to see my vision. I feel this is my life's calling. I'm going for it. </dd>
<dt> What's the rush? </dt>
<dd> If I'm working on this, eventually others with financial incentives and
less benevolent agendas will have similar ideas in mind. I fear the worst, to
put it lightly.  </dd>
