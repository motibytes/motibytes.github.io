I would argue that human nature is to go out for a pack of smokes and not come back; except people really like carrots and there happens to be a trail made of carrots leading home



never knew that, now that is interesting



that's a pretty good argument and mental analogy



and there's multiple areas that would be immediately true in



our habit nature and the lure of comfort would lead us back home until the comfort was gone or our curiosity outweighed our desire to rest



think about that. talk to most people and they'll tell you believe they'd be a great adventurer, they could see themselves exploring and fucking shit up everywhere.



yet as we rely on more comfort we're less likely to take those risks to explore the unknown



and hell besides comfort we've become accustomed to talking about doing things instead of doing them, or even just talking in general



but if you think of a person who has no comforts, their curiosity is primed all the time, they're always ready to go ready to move ready to explore ready to take risks nothing to lose



im envisioning it like a weight scale with two ends, one end is comfort and the other is curiosity, it's always going to be possible to rest, its always going to be possible to take risks, but it will be much harder to take a risk if the scale is weighted on the comfort side.



its almost like the more comfort we have the less of our true nature we are



and we're dissatisfied because we know it



I agree ☝️
The logic Russian hunters use when raising their dogs is that if you provide a puppy with everything it needs and let it come inside at night  it will
Remain a puppy forever and be no use as a hunting dog



this raises a really big question for me. We all want love. We know that if you never let that dog in, it's going to go through a bunch of shit, it's going to have its defenses up, its going to be hard to make a person like that enter a place of vulnerability or intimacy.
So we need some amount of comfort and safety in order to open up to love, a real need that we cannot exist without, just like these other needs.
But if we have too much comfort, we'll become afraid to take risks, which means we will be even less likely to pursue the vulnerability state, which is ironically of course, safety.  
So comfort both brings to us and takes from us safety.
Risk both gives to us and takes from us our likelihood of pursuing safety.
I wonder where the optimal place lies, if there even is one.
It makes me think there is a reason we are not the way we are now all of the time. That entering different states of being is necessary because we cannot be both defensive and vulnerable at once but we also have these multiple needs to be met.
