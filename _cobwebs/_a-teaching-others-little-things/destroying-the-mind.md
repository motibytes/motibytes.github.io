i believe the expression is losing yourself to find yourself. You only get one mind in this life, do exercise caution with what you do to it

Ye, I've heard that before for sure, James. Someone, from a shamanic background, expressed it as, "u have to lose your mind to find your mind".... for me, they feel like different expressions of the same truth üôèüíú

i looked up the quote and the popular adage is "lose your mind to find your soul".
They can be different expressions of the same truth but discretion is necessary here..
If your mind is a computer, you don't want the computer to run you, you want to run the computer.
So the idea would be loosening the control the computer has over you to the point that you can gain the reigns.
The "how" this is gone about, does matter. If you forced yourself to study calculus for 24 hours a day, you'd lose your mind. If you read 100 spiritual books without sleeping for a week, you'd lose your mind. If you took 13 tabs of Acid, you'd lose your mind.
But in these scenarios, "losing your mind" is not talking about moving away from the computer, they're talking about damaging the computer to the extent that it is no longer functioning as designed.
Big and clear difference between the kind of mental destruction that will free you, and the kind of mental destruction that will require you to be hospitalized and be taken care of by others because you destroyed your operating system.

This is something I don't have analogies for. But if the message can get across, me rebooting a computer could be a great idea. Me pouring water onto the motherboard and frying every circuit, not such a great idea

complicated topic because of the nature of mind. Are we talking about deleting the contents in the mind? Or rewriting the structure of the mind? Or modifying the rules themselves that create the structure and basic functioning of the mind?
The higher the level you're dealing with, the more critical to the operation of being and functioning. You don't want to be in an unrecoverable state because everything got jumbled up and scrambled.
That isn't to say you can't modify it to your advantage, but then you are playing with fire.

it is worth considering. As the Buddha's "No Mind" does not mean he destroyed the basic rules in the mind that allowed his mind to operate normally.

instead he moved his awareness to a state where there is no mind. Just as I could move my awareness to a state where there is no arm, instead of cutting off my arm, which I might need someday
