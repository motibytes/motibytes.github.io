start by imagining that gravity is holding you perfectly to the earth,
then that roots are going out of your feet down into the ground from your root chakra(bottom of back of spine),
then imagine that those roots mix in with the soil, then down to the core of the earth,
focus on your heartbeat too,
send loving intentions / good intentions  down to the earth,
also feel the earths energy coming back into you too

and from there you could breathe out love breath in love or whatever you want
