Nearly every person
i think i wanted to say, that its important to have a relationship
with god, regardless of how you understand him to be or if you think he
exists, even if he is only an imaginary friend or a logical construct
in the mind. We are simply engineered that way.



(this may need to be moved to another chapter)

I have an answer like the cross now I can't ignore. I didn't hear it from some hippy lecture, I came to find it on my own.

And I haven't spoken it out loud, but I will eventually. Because every conversation, every single observable phenomenon, everything that happens in this reality, every miracle, every healing, every mention of Christ, all remind me of it every single day.

Once you see it, when you look at other people, when you watch and observe what they do, your heart is always crying out for them.

And you know what you are.



Add to God:
Don't let anyone tell you who God is??? Is that actually good advice?
